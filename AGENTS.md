# Agent and contributor rules

These rules apply to every coding agent and every contributor. `CLAUDE.md`
points here; tool-specific files must not restate or contradict this page.

## Project

TablePro is a Linux-only native database client, being renamed **BookiE**. Work
happens on the `linux` branch in the Rust 1.98 Cargo workspace under `linux/`.

- The rename covers the display name, binary names (`bookie`, `bookie-agentd`)
  and branding assets only. App ID, config and data paths, keyring schema,
  UUIDs, audit format and protocol contracts stay `tablepro` /
  `com.tablepro.linux`. Check the sprint before renaming any of them.
- The UI uses GTK4, libadwaita, GtkSourceView and Relm4. Database drivers are
  static workspace crates registered at compile time. No cross-platform UI
  layers, web views or source for another operating system.
- Every shipped feature works without an account, license key, subscription,
  paid tier or remote entitlement check.
- The root [LICENSE](LICENSE) applies. User-facing changes go in
  [linux/CHANGELOG.md](linux/CHANGELOG.md).

## Where to start

1. [linux/docs/README.md](linux/docs/README.md): the documentation map and where
   each fact belongs.
2. [The active sprint](linux/docs/bookie-0.2-sprint.md): milestone order, 0.2.0
   readiness and acceptance. The [0.2.0 scope](linux/docs/0.2.0-scope.md) lists
   the blockers; everything else is in the [backlog](linux/docs/backlog.md), and
   [known limitations](linux/docs/known-limitations.md) says what the application
   cannot do. 0.2.0 ships as a development release for the Arch and Hyprland
   target, with hotfixes to follow.
3. [The ledger](linux/docs/known-issues.md): every open issue with its status,
   evidence and owner. Pick work from your lane's row in
   [Owners and handoff](linux/docs/known-issues.md#owners-and-handoff).
4. The ADR that governs your change ([index](linux/docs/decisions/README.md)).
   Every type or value change follows
   [ADR 0007](linux/docs/decisions/0007-type-and-value-preservation.md).

Accepted ADRs constrain architecture. The sprint owns sequencing and acceptance;
ROADMAP and PLAN only point to it. Dated reviews and archives prove their
recorded source only; they do not override current decisions.

## Altitude

On conflict, the higher layer wins:

```text
PRINCIPLES.md
  → accepted ADR / BDR (linux/docs/decisions/)
    → specs/<capability> + linux/ARCHITECTURE.md
      → this file (conventions, lanes, Forgejo, tests)
        → code
```

This file remains the agent entry (R1). Standard-shaped files point here and at
the linux homes; they do not replace lane rules or Forgejo merge tiers.

## Standards bridge

Gradual adoption of repository-standards, profile `core`, bookmark
[`.standards-version`](.standards-version) (1.0.19). Layer 2 Node stack is
declined.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) | What BookiE is and is not |
| [docs/personas.md](docs/personas.md) | Who a spec must serve |
| [docs/PRINCIPLES.md](docs/PRINCIPLES.md) | Altitude apex |
| [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) | Vulnerability contact |
| [docs/decision-records/](docs/decision-records/README.md) | Index onto `linux/docs/decisions/` |
| [docs/adoption-assessment.md](docs/adoption-assessment.md) | Gate 2 gap map |
| [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md) | Alignment count only; product work stays in the ledger |
| [specs/](specs/README.md) | PolicyGuard and SSH behaviour extracted from code |
| [docs/standards-updates.md](docs/standards-updates.md) | How to take the next standard delta |

Working language: English. If a shipped skill under `.claude/skills` or a Cursor
skill covers the request, read it before acting. Most lifecycle skills are not
vendored yet (manifest exception; alignment item A-15).

Advisory drift only:

```bash
node scripts/self-verify.mjs --warn --profile core
bash scripts/standards-drift.sh
```

Do not make Forgejo or `forgejo-gate` depend on that number.

## Lanes and ownership

Work is split into lanes. Each open ledger row has exactly one owner in the
owner table, and each lane edits only its own files.

| Lane | Owns |
|---|---|
| B3 | Types, values, drivers and result paths: `core` value and result types, decoders under `crates/drivers/`, grid value display, the [B3 board](linux/docs/type-contract-strategy.md) |
| B4 | Transport, guard, audit, SSH, rollback and acceptance: `policy`, `transport`, `ssh`, audit storage, the [B4 board](linux/docs/b4-task-board.md) |
| UX | The app layer, packaging, CI and the lab, the ledger, and shared documentation. UX also runs the Forgejo gate for every pull request that is green on GitHub and merges it once both agree |
| Cursor | Documentation and tests only. UX reviews its test pull requests; the maintainer merges its documentation pull requests, which need no Forgejo run |
| Maintainer | Decisions and anything needing a person or a real desktop |

- To work in another lane's files, first record the handoff in the ledger
  (the owner table and, for a shared task, a row in the handoff table) in the
  same commit as the first change.
- When a lane finishes a row, cross it out with the commit, PR or test that
  closed it, and remove it from the owner table.
- Each agent works in its own git worktree (for example
  `~/Projects/tablepro-<lane>`), never in another agent's checkout. Branch from
  the latest `linux` fetched from `git@github.com:cozyGarage/BookiE.git` (the
  `fork` remote in this checkout); name branches `<lane>/<topic>` or
  `<type>/<topic>`.

## Workflow

1. Write the failing test first, then the fix, in one commit.
2. Run the checks in [Validation](#validation) locally. Run scripts unpiped:
   `bash linux/scripts/preflight.sh | tail -3` reports `tail`'s status, not the
   script's.
3. Merge the latest BookiE `linux` branch into the branch (do not rebase a
   shared branch). In this checkout, that is `fork/linux`. Resolve generated
   files by regenerating them, for example
   `python3 linux/scripts/inventory-ignored-tests.py > linux/docs/ignored-tests.md`.
4. **Gate on Forgejo:** `bash linux/scripts/forgejo-gate.sh <branch> [remote-branch]`.
   It pushes to the lab Forgejo, waits for that push's run and lists jobs that
   did not pass. Forgejo is the acceptance gate: it runs the merge tier (Docker
   drivers, installed GTK, distro floor, packages) on every branch push. GitHub
   no longer runs the merge tier on pushes to `linux` or `main`: drivers,
   installed GTK, driver TLS, the PostgreSQL release fixture and DuckDB run on
   Forgejo only, so a green GitHub pull request only means the cheap tier ran.
5. Open the GitHub pull request against `linux`, merge it when the Forgejo gate
   is green (squash, subject `<type>(<scope>): <summary> (#N)`), then sync
   Forgejo's `linux` to GitHub's. The UX lane gates and merges every pull request
   that is green on GitHub, using `--match-head-commit`. A push that only merges
   `linux` into a branch, or only regenerates `docs/ignored-tests.md`, does not need
   a new gate: compare the pull request's own diff against `linux` for the gated
   head and the current head (`git diff origin/linux...<head> -- crates scripts`),
   and merge when it is unchanged. Re-gate when the pull request's own code or tests
   changed. Say in the report that the comparison was made.
6. **Documentation-only changes skip CI.** A change that touches only `*.md`
   files and `linux/docs/` is pushed straight to `linux` after
   `python3 linux/scripts/check-doc-links.py`, `check-known-issues.py` and
   `inventory-ignored-tests.py --check` pass. The heavy GitHub workflows ignore
   such pushes; the cheap `linux-ci-contracts` harness still checks them on
   GitHub. `forgejo-gate.sh` runs the same checks and exits without queueing a
   run. Do not use a Forgejo `paths-ignore` filter: Forgejo reads the changed
   files of a merge commit as none, so every branch that merged `linux` would
   silently get no run. Do not push a documentation-only tip to Forgejo's
   `linux`; the next code merge carries it. A change that touches any other file takes the full
   path above.
7. **One gate at a time.** The gate script holds a host lock, so queued gates
   wait for each other. Overlapping runs starve the installed GTK jobs of CPU and
   produce accessibility-timeout failures that mean nothing. A GTK or driver
   failure seen while another run was active is inconclusive until it is
   re-run alone. Never start a second gate by hand to "speed up". The daily full
   run (22:00 UTC) and the nightly workflow (23:00 UTC) run on `linux` at night; a
   queued sync of Forgejo's `linux` waits on the same lock and holds it until its
   run finishes. Runners carry the label `debian-host` (native GTK, widgets and
   release fixtures stay there) and `any-host` (all four executors, used by the
   guard, Clippy, unit, sandbox, supply-chain and distro-floor jobs). A single
   failed job can be re-run from the Forgejo run page without a new push.
8. **Do not repeat work between GitHub and Forgejo.** GitHub runs the cheap tier,
   security, Flatpak and the workflow and harness contracts on pull requests,
   plus at most a weekly scheduled backup run. A push to `linux` does not start
   the merge tier there. Forgejo runs the merge tier on its own executors. Do not re-run a Forgejo
   job to learn what GitHub already reported, and do not trust a skipped GitHub
   job as a pass.
   CodeQL and SonarCloud run on GitHub as reference scans, not gates: fix real
   findings in small pull requests and mark wrong ones "False positive" or
   "Won't fix" with a reason (see validation-playbook, SonarCloud triage).
9. **Merge only on GitHub.** Forgejo is the gate, not the merge target: never merge a
   pull request on Forgejo, and never push to Forgejo's `linux` by hand. A Forgejo
   merge makes its `linux` diverge from GitHub's, and the sync (which only
   fast-forwards) then stops until someone resets it.
10. Never leave a background job, container or lab VM change running that you
   did not start, and never stop one you did not start. On shared executors,
   stop only your own containers by name.

## Principles

1. Security comes first. Validate input at system boundaries and deny unsafe
   operations by default.
2. Fix root causes. Reproduce or trace a defect before changing code.
3. Keep dependencies one-directional and preserve crate boundaries.
4. Use clear names, small functions, early returns and explicit error paths.
5. Do not add comments. Code, types, tests and module boundaries express
   intent. Record only what an external system forces on us and no name can say.
6. Every testable behaviour change needs a regression test.
7. Keep changes focused. Do not mix unrelated cleanup into a fix.
8. No feature gates based on accounts, licenses, subscriptions, payment or
   remote access checks.

## Workspace architecture

The workspace manifest is `linux/Cargo.toml`.
[linux/ARCHITECTURE.md](linux/ARCHITECTURE.md) has the data flow.

- `crates/core`: domain types, driver traits, query results, filters,
  transactions and the driver registry. Depends on no other workspace crate.
- `crates/policy`: statement classification, rules, approvals, masking,
  blast-radius checks and audit types. Depends on `core` only.
- `crates/storage`: saved connections, Secret Service access, query history and
  the audit journal.
- `crates/ssh`: SSH tunnels through built-in `russh` or system OpenSSH.
- `crates/transport`: connection assembly for the GUI and `agentd`: driver
  options, SSH chain, tunnel and the service endpoint used for certificate
  verification.
- `crates/mcp`: MCP authentication, scopes, connection allowlists, rate limits,
  tools and transport.
- `crates/agentd`: headless MCP process and composition root without GTK.
- `crates/drivers/*`: one static crate per engine, implementing `core` traits,
  never depending on the app.
- `crates/app`: the GTK application and composition root.

Dependencies point toward `core`. Domain and driver crates never import GTK or
Relm4. A new engine is a driver crate implementing the `core` contracts, added
to both composition roots, with documented maturity
([adding drivers](linux/docs/adding-drivers.md)) and tests against a real engine.

## UI and async rules

- GTK widgets belong to the glib main context. Database and blocking work never
  run on the GTK thread.
- Relm4 messages drive state transitions; component-scoped commands own work
  whose lifetime belongs to a component. Async outcomes return to the update loop
  before touching widgets. Keep logic out of widget construction so it can be
  unit-tested.
- Cancellation and timeouts reach the database operation (ADR 0005). A dropped
  future is not proof that a driver stopped.
- Late results never replace state from a newer connection, query or request:
  use a generation or request id.

## Security invariants

These apply to the GUI, the MCP server and `tablepro-agentd`.

- Every connection exposed to a consumer is wrapped by `PolicyGuard`. MCP and
  agent code never sees a raw driver connection.
- MCP token scopes say who may call a tool, connection allowlists say which
  connections a token may use, `PolicyGuard` says what SQL may run. All three
  are required.
- Preview, transaction, retry and batch paths pass the same policy checks as
  direct execution.
- Statement handling keeps the order: classify, evaluate rules, request approval
  when required, apply masking, execute, write the audit outcome.
- Denied, failed, cancelled and timed-out operations produce their terminal audit
  state. Audit failure never opens a path around policy.
- MCP input, saved connection files, imported files, environment variables and
  database metadata are untrusted.
- Bind values through driver parameters. Validate and dialect-quote identifiers.
  Never build SQL by joining untrusted text.
- Passwords, tokens and SSH secrets live in Secret Service through
  `tablepro-storage`, never in JSON, command lines, traces, errors or audit
  fields, and stay in `secrecy` types until the driver boundary.
- Bound request sizes, query limits, timeouts and rate limits at external
  interfaces. No unbounded queues or collections controlled by callers.
- MCP tools use least-privilege scopes and deny access when a token, scope,
  allowlist entry or policy decision is missing.
- New dependencies need a license and advisory review against `linux/deny.toml`.

## Rust code style

`linux/rustfmt.toml`, `linux/clippy.toml` and the workspace lints are
authoritative; [code conventions](linux/docs/code-conventions.md) settles
function length, parameters, naming and extraction.

- Rust edition 2024, Rust 1.98, line width 120.
- No comments or doc comments, except the external-system rule above. A Rust
  file may not gain comment lines (`check-comment-lines.py`, baselines in
  `linux/comment-line-baselines.txt`); after deleting comments run
  `python3 linux/scripts/check-comment-lines.py --update` to lower them.
- Early returns; at most three levels of indentation in a function body.
- A function body is at most 60 lines (`check-function-size.py`, baselines in
  `linux/function-size-baselines.txt`: lower a count when you split, never raise
  one). Rust files stay under 1,200 lines (`check-file-size.sh`, baselines in
  `linux/file-size-baselines.txt`: split before growing a listed file).
- Small public APIs; private by default.
- No `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `todo!` or `unimplemented!` in production
  paths. A new integration test file under `tests/` starts with
  `#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic)]`.
- Typed `thiserror` errors across crate boundaries, with context but no secrets.
- Avoid `unsafe`; isolate it behind the smallest safe interface when a native API
  forces it.
- Do not suppress Clippy lints locally to avoid fixing code.
- Logs use `tracing` fields; `print!` and friends are denied. Never log SQL
  parameters, credentials, tokens, connection strings or unmasked results.

## Tests

Unit tests sit next to pure logic; integration tests live in each crate's
`tests/`. Driver behaviour is tested against a real database (testcontainers or
an isolated local database); filesystem tests use `tempfile`. Policy and MCP
changes test denied and allowed cases, scopes, allowlists, approval, masking,
timeouts and audit terminal states. GTK-only behaviour that automation cannot
reach gets manual steps in
[manual verification](linux/docs/manual-verification-0.2-features.md). Never
change a test to accept incorrect behaviour; confirm a new regression test fails
on the unfixed code.

Rules for pull requests that add tests (any agent, including Cursor):

- Assert observable behaviour, such as an outcome, a stored value or an error
  kind, and not rule names, message text or internal identifiers that the code
  owner may rename.
- A test pull request does not change product rules. When a rule looks wrong,
  tell the lane owner and leave the rule alone.
- A new test fails on the code before the fix, or its commit says it pins
  existing behaviour.
- Merge the latest BookiE `linux` branch into the branch and run
  `linux/scripts/preflight.sh`
  before opening the pull request.
- Do not edit ledger rows, sprint text or files that another lane owns
  (for example `policy/src/rules.rs`, owned by B4 in the lane table);
  those edits are what conflict.
- Check the open pull requests for the same files first. When two change the
  same map or sentinel (for example `change-test-map.json`), say which one lands
  first and rebase the other.
- Say in the pull request when it needs the Forgejo gate; the maintainer or the
  UX lane gates the exact head, since these agents cannot reach Forgejo.

Every test belongs to one tier with one script and one gate. Use the
[validation playbook](linux/docs/validation-playbook.md) to pick layers and
`python3 linux/scripts/run-test-layer.py --list` to discover commands.

| Tier | Contents | Script |
|---|---|---|
| unit | `--lib --bins` across the workspace | `linux/scripts/preflight.sh` |
| sandbox | integration targets needing no Docker, database or display | `linux/scripts/test-sandbox.sh` |
| driver | `crates/drivers/*/tests/integration.rs`, SSH and socket fixtures | `linux/scripts/ci-local.sh integration` |
| driver-tls | `crates/driver-tls-tests` | `linux/scripts/test-driver-tls.sh` |
| release | `crates/release-tests` against PostgreSQL | `linux/scripts/test-postgres-release.sh` |
| gtk-widgets | `#[ignore]` widget tests listed in `linux/scripts/isolated-tests.json` under `gtk` | `linux/scripts/test-gtk-widgets.sh` |
| keyring | `#[ignore]` tests listed under `keyring` | `linux/scripts/test-secret-service.sh` |
| gtk | `crates/app/tests/gtk_safety.py` on an installed build | `linux/scripts/test-gtk-safety.sh` |

All tiers run on Forgejo (`.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml` and `nightly.yml`). New
gtk-widgets and keyring tests must be added to `isolated-tests.json`, and the
ignored-test inventory regenerated, or the tier fails. A new crate goes into the
crate lists in `preflight.sh` and `test-sandbox.sh`.

## Validation

From the repository root, narrow test first, then:

```bash
bash linux/scripts/preflight.sh            # size, panic and bounded-operation guards, fmt, clippy, unit, sandbox
bash linux/scripts/test-gtk-widgets.sh     # when GTK code changed
python3 linux/scripts/check-known-issues.py && python3 linux/scripts/check-doc-links.py   # when docs changed
cargo deny check                           # from linux/, when dependencies changed
bash linux/scripts/forgejo-gate.sh <branch>
```

Driver integration tests need Docker. If a prerequisite is missing, say which
check could not run and why.

## Changelog and commits

- [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) in
  `linux/CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`: one line per user-facing change,
  describing user impact, with no paths, type or function names. Test coverage,
  evidence runs and audits are not changelog entries; record them on the owning
  board or in `linux/docs/evidence/`. Do not add `Fixed` for a defect introduced
  and fixed before release.
- Conventional Commits with a single-line subject and no body. Types: `feat`,
  `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`,
  `revert`, `security`. Scopes such as `app`, `core`, `policy`, `mcp`, `agentd`,
  `storage`, `ssh`, `drivers`, `driver-postgres`.
- A public API change updates every caller and test in the same commit.

## Documentation rules

The [documentation map](linux/docs/README.md) says where each fact lives and
where a new document goes. In short: decisions in ADRs, open work in the ledger,
order and acceptance in the sprint, run-specific proof in `linux/docs/evidence/`
or the PR, dated reviews in `linux/docs/archive/`. Write each fact once and link
to it. Keep file paths stable; scripts and other lanes depend on them.

## Writing style

Short, plain sentences. Be specific. No em dashes, sales language or generic
praise. User-facing text describes behaviour and next steps without internal
errors or secrets.
