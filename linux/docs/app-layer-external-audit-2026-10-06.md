# App layer external audit and UX lane plan

Reviewed 2026-10-06. This is a source review and action plan. It does not
record a runtime pass, and it does not change B3/B4 acceptance or authorize a
release.

## Scope and evidence

| Source | Pin | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BookiE `linux/crates/app` | branch `b3/clickhouse-nested-xlsx-consumer` at `2931da3ba` | Read-only source audit; `cargo build -p tablepro-app` succeeded; app not launched |
| [TableProApp/TablePro](https://github.com/TableProApp/TablePro/tree/976cf4798053715eef90ed8eb47eebcc4718c590) | `976cf4798053715eef90ed8eb47eebcc4718c590` (2026-10-06) | Tree listing, `docs/features/*.mdx`, Swift view folders. No clone or build |
| [t8y2/dbx](https://github.com/t8y2/dbx/tree/d9338d1a3594e5b36fdfeb7d0b67d10e686adbfc) | `d9338d1a3594e5b36fdfeb7d0b67d10e686adbfc` (2026-10-06), Apache-2.0 | Shallow clone in a scratch directory. Nothing built or run |

Linux status values in this file come from source and grep checks. Every GUI
flow still lacks installed acceptance in
[manual verification](manual-verification-0.2-features.md). The
[September adoption matrix](upstream-adoption.md) is partly stale: Jump to
Column and XLSX export now exist.

Paths below are relative to `linux/crates/app/src` unless stated.

## Finding: the app is usable, the first hour is not

Browse, edit and commit; the SQL editor with sessions, parameters, files,
history and favorites; structure editing; CSV import; and seven export formats
are wired end to end. Every GUI database path goes through `PolicyGuard` via
`services/database_service.rs:346-395`, with one exception listed below.

The blockers are in the first hour of use, not in the data paths.

### Ranked gaps for "connect and start using"

| # | Gap | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | A saved connection cannot be edited. The dialog supports a bound id but is always opened with `None` | `ui/app/connection.rs:39`, `ui/connect_dialog/mod.rs:49,451`, row actions in `ui/connection_row.rs:92-127` |
| G2 | A failed connect shows a modal with Close only. No Retry, no Edit. Startup restore fails the same way | `ui/app/connection.rs:370-381`, `ui/app/status_pages.rs:50-60` |
| G3 | A connect in progress cannot be cancelled | `ui/app/status_pages.rs:21-38` |
| G4 | TLS defaults to VerifyFull, which is correct. A local container then fails with a handshake error and no hint | `ui/connect_dialog/mod.rs:215`, `ui/error_text.rs:31` |
| G5 | SQLite path and TLS CA are text entries with no file picker and no "create new" | `ui/connect_dialog/mod.rs:216,679` |
| G6 | The SQL editor has no find or replace. `Ctrl+F` is bound to the browse filter and shows a toast in editor tabs | no `SearchContext` in `ui/`; `ui/app/shortcuts.rs:103`; `ui/app/browse.rs:341-345` |
| G7 | No database or schema switcher. Core has no `list_databases` | `core/src/connection.rs:115-135` |
| G8 | A second launch exits silently instead of raising the window | `lib.rs` single-instance block |
| G9 | Plain `cargo run` shares config, keyring schema and lock with an installed build. `TABLEPRO_PROFILE` is compile-time and not in the README | `storage/src/paths.rs:5-18`, `config.rs:3` |
| G10 | No read-only value viewer or row inspector for long, JSON or binary values in editor results | `ui/grid/context_menu.rs:319-357`, `ui/grid/display.rs:83` |
| G11 | Multi-statement results use one switcher button per statement and do not scale | `ui/editor/outcomes.rs:206-231` |
| G12 | Sidebar is a flat tables/views list. Other objects only appear in the Catalog window | `ui/sidebar_row.rs:11-14`, `ui/app/init_sidebar.rs:140-160` |
| G13 | Export covers loaded rows or the current page only | `ui/export_dialog.rs:184-187` |
| G14 | No column hide/reorder and no find in grid | no grep hit; TablePro #32, #33, #35 |
| G15 | Thin preferences: no theme override, null style, font family or vim mode | `services/preferences.rs:17-33` |

Smaller items: the connect dialog preselects ClickHouse because drivers sort
alphabetically (`ui/connect_dialog/mod.rs:164`); Test Connection feedback is a
transient raw toast (`:546-556`); `Ctrl+/` is bound both to the shortcuts
window and to editor comment toggle (`ui/app/shortcuts.rs:96`,
`ui/editor/mod.rs:485-500`) and needs a live check.

### Guard coverage of the connect dialog

Test Connection and the real Connect both list tables (and Connect lists
views) on the raw driver connection returned by `establish`
(`ui/connect_dialog/mod.rs:516-525`, `:843-850`). That connection is not yet
registered with `DatabaseService` and is never handed to a consumer, but
`PolicyGuard` audits metadata reads (`policy/src/guard/connection.rs:14`), so
these two reads leave no audit record. This is pre-handout bootstrap, not a
bypass. Whether bootstrap reads need a guard belongs to the B4 session
ownership work, so no UX packet changes it.

## What to adopt from TablePro

TablePro's window is: connections rail, sidebar (tables/favorites, tree),
tab strip, editor over results, trailing inspector pane, and a results status
bar. Of 87 cataloged UI functions, about 22 exist on Linux, 33 are partial,
28 are missing and 4 are excluded (AI, Apple services, license-gated charts).

Adopt, in this order of value against cost. Each keeps policy, bounded fetches
and owning-connection identity.

| Rank | Function | GTK route | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Editor find and replace | `GtkSourceSearchContext` under a `GtkSearchBar`; focus-aware `Ctrl+F`/`Ctrl+H` | S |
| 2 | Find in loaded rows, then "search all rows" as a governed filter rule | `GtkSearchBar` over the page model | S-M |
| 3 | Column visibility and saved order | `GtkColumnViewColumn::set_visible`, popover checklist, persist with `services/column_widths.rs` | M |
| 4 | Database/schema switcher (`Ctrl+K`) | Header `GtkMenuButton` with searchable `GtkListView`; switch through transport | M, needs core |
| 5 | Row inspector side pane | `AdwOverlaySplitView` trailing pane; table info with no selection | M |
| 6 | FK picker and navigate to referenced row | Paginated `GtkListView` popover; open filtered browse tab | M-L |
| 7 | Enum, set and boolean pickers | Extend `CellEditorKind` in `ui/grid/types.rs` | S |
| 8 | Statement navigation, run and advance, current-statement band | `GtkSourceMark`/tag over existing `statement_cursor.rs` boundaries | S-M |
| 9 | Preview tabs | Flag per `AdwTabPage`, promote on double-click/sort/filter/edit | S |
| 10 | MRU tab switcher on `Ctrl+Tab` | MRU list in `ui/app/workspace_tabs.rs` | S |
| 11 | Open Quickly scopes, tables and commands | Extend `ui/quick_switcher_dialog.rs` | S |
| 12 | Named and pinnable result tabs, Fetch All | `AdwTabView` in `ui/editor/outcomes.rs` | M |
| 13 | Server output (NOTICE, PRINT) | Outcome page; needs a core trait hook | M, needs core |
| 14 | History as a docked drawer | Move `ui/history_dialog.rs` content into a `GtkPaned` | S-M |
| 15 | Paste TSV into grid | Pure parser, stage through `services/change_tracker.rs` | M, B3-adjacent |
| 16 | Page-size menu, jump to page, estimated count | `GtkMenuButton`, `GtkSpinButton` | S-M |
| 17 | Context-sensitive header bar actions | `gio::Menu` rebuilt on tab switch | S |
| 18 | Appearance: color scheme, editor scheme, font | `AdwStyleManager`, `GtkSourceStyleSchemeChooserWidget`, `GtkFontDialogButton` | S |
| 19 | Schema tree sidebar with richer context menu | `GtkTreeListModel` + `GtkTreeExpander` | M-L |
| 20 | Vim mode | `GtkSourceVimIMContext` plus a preference | S |

Not for 0.2: code folding (no GtkSourceView 5 API), ER diagram, map mode,
visual EXPLAIN diagram, move tab to new window (needs cross-window session
sharing), connections rail (conflicts with one connection per window; needs a
decision first). Excluded: AI, iCloud, Handoff, license, runtime plugins.

## What to learn from dbx

dbx is Tauri 2 with Vue 3 over a 27-crate Rust workspace. It has about 25k
stars and near-daily releases since April 2026. Its UI is monolithic
(`DataGrid.vue` 708 KB, `queryStore.ts` 472 KB), but its seams are good.

Adopt these patterns:

1. **One backend facade for the UI.** All frontend calls go through
   `apps/desktop/src/lib/backend/api.ts`. About 222 UI spec files mock it, so
   UI work never waits on the backend.
2. **Pure logic beside the widget.** `lib/dataGrid/` holds about 90 small
   tested modules (sort, clipboard, selection, transpose, widths). Our
   `services/` already does this. Keep doing it for every new UI feature.
3. **Typed action registry.** `lib/editor/shortcutRegistry.ts` drives
   shortcuts, Quick Open and the tab switcher from one table of action ids.
4. **Cancel answers `{requested, terminal}`.** The UI shows "stopping" and
   "stopped" as different states. This matches our operation control.
5. **Large values as preview plus byte count**, fetched in full on demand.
6. **Versioned error envelope** with stable code and an
   `operation_outcome: not_started | unknown` field that forbids automatic
   replay.
7. **Per-engine edit adapter** (`relational | document | unsupported`)
   instead of engine checks inside the grid.

Do not adopt:

- Cells as `serde_json::Value`, binary as `"0x…"` text and BLOB previews as
  strings. ADR 0007 forbids losing the binary/text distinction.
- Grid edits and user WHERE input spliced into SQL text with embedded
  literals (`crates/dbx-sql-data/src/data_grid_sql.rs`). We bind values and
  quote identifiers.
- Regex production-safety and a "write unlock" toggle in place of policy.
- Passwords crossing the UI boundary as plain strings.
- Commands taking about 15 positional primitives. Use typed request structs.
- Web views, runtime plugins and JDBC sidecars.

## Making UI work parallel to B3

The friction point today is that widgets match directly on
`tablepro_core::Value` (`ui/grid/column.rs:196-212`, 14 files under `ui/`),
and `AppMsg` is a single enum of about 150 variants. Every B3 change and every
UI feature meet in the same files.

### File ownership

Commits since 2026-09-15 that touched `crates/app` show these B3-hot files.
UX packets do not edit them without coordinating with the B3 owner:

`browse_tab/value_parse.rs`, `browse_tab/row_ops.rs`, `grid/display.rs`,
`grid/column.rs`, `grid/export.rs`, `export_dialog.rs`, `import_dialog.rs`,
`ui/app/import.rs`, `services/change_tracker.rs`, `tests/support/*_contract.rs`.

Shared, high churn, keep edits small: `ui/app/mod.rs`, `ui/app/msg.rs`,
`editor/mod.rs`, `editor/statement_cursor.rs`, `ui/app/connection.rs`,
`connect_dialog/mod.rs`.

Safe for UX work: `welcome_view.rs`, `connection_row.rs`,
`connect_dialog/form.rs`, `connect_dialog/identity.rs`, `ssh_section.rs`,
`preferences.rs`, `quick_switcher*`, `saved_queries_dialog.rs`,
`history_dialog.rs`, `activity_dialog.rs`, `explain_dialog.rs`,
`catalog_dialog.rs`, `editor/completion.rs`, `editor/schema.rs`,
`sidebar_row.rs`, `ui/app/init_sidebar.rs`, `structure_tab/*`,
`ui/app/shortcuts.rs`, `ui/app/status_pages.rs`.

### Foundation packets

These are small and make later UX work cheaper. They are not prerequisites
for Phase 1.

| ID | Deliverable | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UX-F1 | A `CellView` display model and one `cell_view(&Value, &ColumnInfo)` mapping in `ui/grid/`. Widgets render `CellView` only. `grid/display.rs` already holds most of the text logic; this names it as the boundary | B3 owns the mapping and its ADR 0007 tests; UX owns widgets |
| UX-F2 | A fake `tablepro_core` connection in a test-support location, wrapped by the real `PolicyGuard`, serving canned pages, slow pages, errors and cancellation | UX; used by the gtk-widgets tier |
| UX-F3 | New features add `AppMsg::<Feature>(<Feature>Msg)` and an `ui/app/<feature>.rs` impl file instead of new top-level variants | UX convention, recorded in [code conventions](code-conventions.md) when first used |
| UX-F4 | One action table in `ui/app/shortcuts.rs` that feeds accelerators, the shortcuts dialog and Open Quickly commands | UX |

## Action plan

### Phase 0: use it today (no code)

1. Start the [manual connection fixture](../tests/manual-connections/README.md).
2. Build an isolated development profile so tests never touch daily data:
   `cd linux && TABLEPRO_PROFILE=development cargo run -p tablepro-app`.
   Use a plain `cargo run -p tablepro-app` only for real daily connections.
3. Set TLS to **Disabled** for fixture connections.
4. Keep a dogfood log of every friction point with steps. New items join this
   table as UX packets, not as B3/B4 tasks.

### Phase 1: first hour fixed (target: one week, S-sized, safe files)

| ID | Packet | Gap | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UX-1 | Edit saved connection from the welcome row and the window menu | G1 | Changing host/password/TLS persists; secret stays in Secret Service; unit test for bound-id save |
| UX-2 | Connect failure: Retry and Edit Connection actions; startup restore falls back to the welcome view | G2 | Pure state test for the recovery choice; manual check |
| UX-3 | Cancel button on the connecting toast, reaching the transport | G3 | Cancelled connect leaves no registered connection |
| UX-4 | Connect dialog: file pickers for SQLite and CA, "create new SQLite file", PostgreSQL as default driver, TLS hint when a local host fails the handshake | G4, G5 | Unit tests for default and hint selection |
| UX-5 | Editor find and replace; `Ctrl+F` routes by focused tab | G6 | Shortcut routing unit test; manual check |
| UX-6 | Second launch raises the existing window; document `TABLEPRO_PROFILE` in the README | G8, G9 | Manual check; README diff |

### Phase 2: daily workflows (two to three weeks)

| ID | Packet | Source rank | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UX-7 | Read-only value viewer and row inspector pane | TablePro 5, G10 | Consumes UX-F1; no edit path changes |
| UX-8 | Column visibility and order | TablePro 3, G14 | Persistence beside column widths |
| UX-9 | Find in loaded rows | TablePro 2, G14 | Pure matcher over the page model |
| UX-10 | Named, pinnable result tabs | TablePro 12, G11 | `outcomes.rs` only |
| UX-11 | Statement navigation and current-statement band | TablePro 8 | Coordinate with `statement_cursor.rs` churn |
| UX-12 | Preview tabs and MRU switcher | TablePro 9, 10 | `workspace_tabs.rs` |
| UX-13 | Appearance preferences and vim mode | TablePro 18, 20, G15 | `preferences.rs` |
| UX-14 | History drawer and Open Quickly scopes/commands | TablePro 11, 14 | Uses UX-F4 |
| UX-15 | Database/schema switcher | TablePro 4, G7 | Needs a core `list_databases` capability per driver and an ADR 0008 check on session ownership. Plan with B4 before starting |

### Phase 3: depth (after B3 settles the grid and export paths)

Schema tree sidebar, FK navigation, enum/set pickers, paste TSV, full-table and
streaming export, server output, page-size and estimated counts. Each touches
B3-hot files or core contracts and is scheduled with that owner.

## Rules for every UX packet

- Follow `CLAUDE.md`: no comments, function and file size guards, a regression
  test in the lowest tier that reproduces the change, changelog entry under
  `[Unreleased]`.
- Logic goes in a pure function or `services/` module with unit tests. Widget
  code stays thin. GTK-only checks list manual steps and light/dark
  screenshots.
- No new database path outside `PolicyGuard`. No SQL built from UI text.
- A UX packet does not close any B3, B4 or B7 acceptance item. B7
  qualification still needs installed Arch and Debian/GNOME runs at a frozen
  SHA.
