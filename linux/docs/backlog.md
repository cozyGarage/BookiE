# Backlog after 0.2.0

Rows here are real work that does not block 0.2.0. The ledger keeps the evidence;
this page keeps the order. Draft of 2026-10-11, for the maintainer.

## 0.2.x features

| Row | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SNAP-1 to SNAP-4 | Database snapshots: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, then SQLite and DuckDB file copies | ADR 0015; limit 5 snapshots per database |
| UI-1b | Edit SSH jump chains in the form | Storage landed in #490; transport and bundle v2 are in review; edits stay refused until the whole path passes together |
| UI-19 | Foreign key picker and navigation, enum and set pickers, paste TSV, estimated counts | |
| UI-20 | Server output (NOTICE, PRINT) and a timing breakdown | with PERF-4 |
| UI-15b | Null display style preference | |
| UI-17b, UI-18, UI-22, UI-23, UI-26 | Preview tabs, history as a panel, code folding and split panes, more PostgreSQL catalog objects, editable SSH profiles | accepted for later |
| PKG-2 | Debian and GNOME desktop pass (UI-D1 to D4) | the packages keep building and passing the distro floor in CI; this is the desktop acceptance |
| PKG-4, PKG-8 | Flatpak build, Flathub submission, and the file-access decision (`--filesystem=home` or portal only) | not part of 0.2.0; decide PKG-8 before PKG-4 |

## Performance

| Row | What |
|---|---|
| PERF-2, PERF-7, PERF-8 | Stream results instead of materialising up to three caps; progressive loading in the editor |
| PERF-3 | MongoDB browse on large collections (partly fixed in #493) |
| PERF-4 | Server time next to elapsed time |
| PERF-5, PERF-6 | Idle memory and binary size, accepted for now |

## Quality and tooling

| Row | What |
|---|---|
| TEST-2 | Broad mutation audit: policy and core are measured (see [TEST-32](oracle-review.md)); transport, ssh and storage are not |
| TEST-12 | MongoDB metadata sample consistency |
| UI-21, TEST-28 | Fake connection for the GTK tier, native Ubuntu AT-SPI menu reachability |
| TEST-30 | Remaining SonarCloud and CodeQL findings |
| AUD-5 | About 4,700 comment lines in `src/` to move into docs, file by file |
| DOC-3, DOC-5 | Orca and high contrast pass; value comparison with DBeaver and dbx |
| B4-9, B4-11, B4-17, B4-21 | Route and TLS acceptance evidence, failed-batch rollback on other MySQL storage engines, native multi-hop trust flow, a deterministic KDC fixture for SQL Server Kerberos |
| UI-13b | Consistent snapshot for a full export (ADR 0014) |

## Infrastructure

- Enable Hyper-Threading on two lab hosts, raise executor sizes, split runners by
  job class, then allow two gates to overlap.
- Folder layout: separate the platform-neutral crates from the Linux application,
  and test suites from code (see the layout proposal when the maintainer asks for it).
