# Value preservation tests

Evidence availability checked October 3: some dated `target/quality` links below are unavailable in this checkout. They remain historical references, not current passes. See [the evidence consistency review](architecture-consistency-review-2026-10-03.md#evidence-audit) and its inventory for exact paths; retrieve exact-SHA artifacts or rerun before using missing raw proof for acceptance.


B3 uses a shared boundary corpus at `testdata/value-contract.json`. Tests must
compare the submitted value with the returned value, not just check that a query
succeeded. A NULL, an empty value, an unsupported value and a failed conversion
are different outcomes.

## Run

```bash
./scripts/test-value-contracts.sh --gtk --duckdb
./scripts/test-value-contracts.sh --gtk --duckdb --unit-only
```

The first command covers all eight drivers plus grid, filter, CSV import, named parameter, JSON
export and MCP conversion paths. Docker is required for the six server engines;
SQLite and DuckDB run locally. GTK development libraries are required for the
grid parser. Without `--gtk` or `--duckdb`, the report explicitly records those
exclusions. `--unit-only` keeps the same compilation configuration and runs only
the parser and consumer suites.

The runner compiles once, reads Cargo's test artifact records, and executes each
selected binary. A missing suite, zero matching tests, compilation error, test
failure or five-minute fixture timeout makes the command fail. Every selected suite gets a log and the combined
report is under `target/quality/*-values/report.json`. Failures in one engine do
not prevent the other compiled suites from running.
Integration tests are selected by the `value_contract` name prefix; new driver
value-contract tests must use that prefix or they will run in the full crate
suite but be excluded from this focused layer.

## CSV regression audit, 2026-09-29

The [regression audit](regression-audit-2026-09-29.md) reproduced two missing
consumer cases. Formula-safe negative decimal imports rounded values beyond
Decimal's exact scale, and binary CSV exports used a `\x` prefix the importer
did not accept. The shared parsers now refuse excess decimal precision and
accept that binary prefix. Ordinary hex and SQL-style prefixes remain supported.

The core binary contract exports and imports NULL, empty bytes and all 256 byte
values with each of the four delimiters. A real SQLite contract then builds the
import plan, executes policy-guarded batches and checks native blob/null storage,
exact bytes and the terminal audit count. Decimal units test both raw and
formula-safe inputs beyond the exact scale, alongside existing valid negative
and trailing-zero cases. These are separate from deliberate unsupported native
types and installed grid acceptance.

PostgreSQL/MySQL fixture scenarios extracted to `tests/support/value_contracts.rs`
remain part of their `integration` target. Their module prefixes change displayed
test names; the `value_contract` selection still includes them.

## Full drivers layer, 2026-09-30

After integrating the remote Linux updates, the strict `drivers` layer passed
all six server drivers, PostgreSQL socket, SSH agent authentication and OpenSSH
sessions: 200 tests, zero failures. Evidence:
[`20260930T001431188722Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T001431188722Z-layers/report.json)
and its detailed [`drivers-1.log`](../target/quality/20260930T001431188722Z-layers/drivers-1.log).

The first integrated rerun caught a fixture mistake: `.990` legacy `datetime`
lands on an exact every-third 1/300-second tick and is correctly decodable. The
regression now uses `.997` and `.003`, which occupy inexact ticks; it compares
their decoder results with SQL Server's native text, requires SQL export refusal,
and separately round-trips supported temporal columns. The focused Docker test
and the full integrated drivers layer passed.

The integrated strict shared-values runner also passed all 135 selected tests
across GTK, DuckDB, all eight drivers and MCP, with no missing suites:
[`20260930T002923239431Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T002923239431Z-values/report.json).

The latest full driver-layer run, at clean source SHA
`f88159dcb23dd74a960c638a6af42b608a1b4345`, passed 220 tests across the six
server drivers, local PostgreSQL socket, SSH-agent authentication and OpenSSH
sessions, with no failures or ignored tests in executed suites. It explicitly
ran the connection-loss and mid-stream/partial-result contracts for each
remote driver, plus PostgreSQL/MySQL pool recovery and the other drivers'
restart/reconnect paths. Evidence:
[`20260930T232244336622Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T232244336622Z-layers/report.json)
and [`drivers-1.log`](../target/quality/20260930T232244336622Z-layers/drivers-1.log).
The layer took 984 seconds, reflecting the Docker-backed end-to-end coverage.

## B3 mutation survivor re-audit, 2026-10-01

I reran two old survivor groups against the current source and test set. The
ClickHouse `clickhouse_datetime64_fits_precision` scope caught all 16 viable
mutations; the former `precision > 9` to `precision >= 9` survivor is now
caught by the exact scale-9 boundary assertion. The core CSV `column_kind`
scope caught 13 of 14 mutations; one was unviable, with no misses or timeouts.
This supersedes older CSV classifier reports whose tests predated the current
type-name matrix.

The JSON exporter scope caught 6 of 7 mutations. Its sole survivor deletes the
explicit `Value::Null` match arm, but that is behaviorally equivalent: the
fallback `value_to_text(Value::Null)` returns `None`, which `value_to_json`
also maps to JSON null. Existing exporter contracts separately assert SQL NULL
as JSON null and text `"null"` as JSON string. This is classified as an
equivalent mutant, not a missed behavior assertion. The focused contract
`value_contract_json_keeps_null_and_booleans_distinct_from_text` passed with
both SQL NULL and text `"null"`. The full strict GTK+DuckDB value runner also
passed all 165 selected tests across 11 suites on the updated working tree:
[`20260930T235608800228Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T235608800228Z-values/report.json).
The quick layer passed after this change:
[`20261001T000036771872Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T000036771872Z-layers/report.json).

## MySQL wide DECIMAL CSV import, 2026-10-01

A failing-first core test reproduced that a valid `DECIMAL(65,30)` CSV value
was rejected as `NotANumber`, although MySQL results preserve values outside
Rust `Decimal` as exact text. Typed import now uses the destination's declared
precision and scale to permit a plain numeric text fallback only when that
value fits the declared type and Rust `Decimal` cannot represent it. Invalid
numeric tokens, malformed type metadata, values beyond the destination's
precision/scale, and high-precision values for unspecified `decimal` metadata
remain errors. A valid `DECIMAL(30,30)` with no integer digits remains accepted.
The metadata parser allows MySQL's `UNSIGNED` and `ZEROFILL` modifiers but
rejects unknown and repeated suffixes; this prevents malformed column metadata
from enabling the text fallback.

The MySQL 8 Docker contract covers a 65-digit integer and a negative
`DECIMAL(65,30)` with formula-safe CSV output. It compares exact JSON strings,
imports CSV using destination catalog metadata, writes the values through
bound parameters and SQL literals, then compares `HEX(CAST(value AS CHAR))`
with the source for both rows. Focused core tests and the live contract passed.
The initial scoped mutation run caught all 30 generated mutations, with no
misses, timeouts, or unviable cases. A follow-up metadata audit added
`DECIMAL(65,0) UNSIGNED` to the live fixture and malformed suffix cases to core
tests; all 489 core tests and the MySQL live contract passed. The latest scoped
run caught all 36 generated mutations, with no misses, timeouts, or unviable
cases:
[`20261001-wide-decimal-metadata-mutants-full-core`](../target/quality/20261001-wide-decimal-metadata-mutants-full-core/mutants.out/outcomes.json).
The strict GTK+DuckDB values layer passed 168
selected tests across 11 suites:
[`20261001T002624272378Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T002624272378Z-values/report.json).
After the metadata-suffix change, it passed again with 168 selected tests across
all 11 suites and no missing suites:
[`20261001T011112385634Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T011112385634Z-values/report.json).
The quick layer also passed:
[`20261001T003205886474Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T003205886474Z-layers/report.json).
After the suffix-validation change, the quick layer passed again, including
formatting, Clippy, sandbox tests and the standalone Redis cancellation target:
[`20261001T011619474080Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T011619474080Z-layers/report.json).
The earlier 30-mutant report is
[`20261001-wide-decimal-csv-mutants-final3`](../target/quality/20261001-wide-decimal-csv-mutants-final3/mutants.out/outcomes.json).

## MySQL PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH fixed-width text, 2026-10-01

A live MySQL contract now runs with `PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH` enabled and
checks that a `CHAR(5)` value returns all five characters, including trailing
spaces. It verifies the native `CHAR_LENGTH` and `HEX` values, CSV export and
typed CSV import, then repeats the write through both bound parameters and SQL
literal insertion. Each destination is compared with the source using native
length and byte oracles. The focused Docker contract and MySQL integration
Clippy check passed. The strict GTK+DuckDB value layer passed 169 selected tests
across all 11 suites, including eight MySQL scenarios and this contract:
[`20261001T013200347651Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T013200347651Z-values/report.json).

```

## SQL Server datetimeoffset CSV import, 2026-10-01

A failing-first extension to the live `datetimeoffset(7)` contract reproduced a
CSV import failure: SQL Server's space-separated timestamp with a numeric UTC
offset was rejected as `NotATimestamp`. Parsing it as the shared UTC-normalized
`TimestampTz` value would also discard the original stored offset. The CSV type
classifier now keeps `datetimeoffset` as exact text. A core test pins all seven
fractional digits and the `+05:30` offset.

The Docker-backed driver contract now checks exact JSON output, CSV export and
production CSV import, then inserts the imported values using native bound
parameters. An independent SQL Server query compares both the instant and
`DATEPART(TZOFFSET, ...)` with the source for five offsets, including calendar
extremes. The focused test passed after first reproducing the failure. Scoped
mutation testing of `temporal_kind` caught 4 of 5 generated mutations; one was
unviable, with no missed or timed-out mutants. The strict runner passed 165
selected tests across all 11 suites:
[`20260930T230409137178Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T230409137178Z-values/report.json).
The quick layer also passed after the documentation update:
[`20260930T231132409175Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T231132409175Z-layers/report.json).

```sh

```

## DuckDB zero-row result metadata, 2026-09-28

A local DuckDB query selects a `HUGEINT` and `VARCHAR` under `WHERE false`.
The result has no rows and is not truncated, but keeps the ordered aliases and
Arrow-backed metadata (`Decimal128(38, 0)` and `Utf8`). A second query checks
DuckDB's native `typeof` values are `HUGEINT` and `VARCHAR`, so driver metadata
is recorded separately from engine type names.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration query_with_zero_rows_preserves_column_metadata_and_completeness -- --exact
```

The focused local DuckDB contract passed.

## PostgreSQL zero-row result metadata and ordered delivery, 2026-09-29

A PostgreSQL Docker contract first reproduced a result-delivery defect: a
zero-row `SELECT` returned no column metadata because the driver populated
names and types only from the first `PgRow`. The driver now prepares an empty
result to recover its statement metadata, using the original parameter types
for bound queries. The regression checks ordered names and native types for
plain and parameterized empty results, then checks duplicate aliases, values,
and row order for a populated result.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_result_delivery_keeps_zero_row_metadata_duplicate_names_and_order -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused Docker contract passed against PostgreSQL; the empty-result
metadata defect is fixed. The strict combined runner later passed all 120
selected contracts on the source tree including this regression and the added
numeric parser cases; see
[`20260929T161811049211Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260929T161811049211Z-values/report.json).

## PostgreSQL server termination and pool recovery, 2026-09-29

A failing-first Docker contract terminated an active PostgreSQL backend and
showed SQLSTATE `57P01` was surfaced as an ordinary query error. The driver now
classifies PostgreSQL server termination states `57P01` through `57P04` as
`Disconnected`; the normal query-cancel state `57014` remains a query error. The
contract checks that the terminated operation fails visibly and that the same
pooled connection can complete a fresh `SELECT 1` afterward. A second Docker test
stops and restarts PostgreSQL on a stable mapped host port; the existing pool must
report the outage as `Disconnected` and then complete a new `SELECT 1`. A unit contract
distinguishes the termination states from query cancellation and constraint
errors. A second failing-first unit case showed generic SQLx socket EOF/reset
errors also surfaced as `Internal`; those now map to `Disconnected`, while
connection refusal and TLS errors retain their distinct classifications.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-postgres --lib server_termination_states_are_disconnections_but_query_cancel_is_not
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-postgres --lib unexpected_io_eof_is_disconnected_and_connection_refusal_stays_distinct
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration server_terminated_query_reports_disconnection_and_pool_recovers -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration disconnection::a_restarted_postgres_server_restores_the_existing_pool -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

All 35 PostgreSQL unit tests and the focused Docker test passed. The SQLSTATE
mutation run caught both generated changes; the socket/error-classification run
caught 7 of 8 mutants, with one unviable. The clean strict value runner passed
131 selected tests across all 11 suites at source
`12e795cec416fca9da92ed1c95ae6bd9b77e754e`, with no missing suites. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260929-pg-disconnect-mutants-home/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
`target/quality/20260929-pg-io-disconnect-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
and `target/quality/20260929T212538645091Z-values/report.json` (`dirty: false`).

## MySQL server termination and pool recovery, 2026-09-29

A failing-first MySQL Docker contract killed the connection serving an active
`SLEEP` query. The server closed the socket with unexpected EOF, which the SQLx
mapper previously surfaced as `Internal`. The driver now maps SQLx I/O failures
to `Disconnected`, while keeping connection refusal and TLS errors distinct.
The integration contract requires the killed query to fail promptly, then checks
the pool completes a new `SELECT 1`. A second Docker test stops and restarts MySQL
on a stable mapped host port; the existing pool must return `Disconnected` during
the outage and then complete a new `SELECT 1`. Unit tests separately preserve
`ConnectionRefused` and unexpected EOF classifications.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-mysql --lib
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-mysql --test integration server_terminated_query_reports_disconnection_and_pool_recovers -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-mysql --test integration a_restarted_mysql_server_restores_the_existing_pool -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused integration test and all 12 MySQL library tests passed. The first
scoped mutation pass found the connection-refusal branch lacked its own
assertion; after adding it, all three viable mutations were caught and one was
unviable. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260929-mysql-disconnect-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The clean strict runner passed 131 selected tests across 11 suites at source
`064b4947d07d4fddbc2a210c0d658f62cef59805`; no suites were missing:
`target/quality/20260929T211702925065Z-values/report.json` (`dirty: false`).

### MySQL mid-stream disconnect completeness, 2026-09-30

A Docker regression streams 100 rows with a short delay per row, waits until
MySQL reports the query active, then kills its connection after row production
has begun. The driver must return `Disconnected` for the whole query, not a
partial result, and the pool must complete a fresh `SELECT 1`. The focused
integration test passed locally: 1 test passed. Mid-stream or mid-page
whole-operation failure cases now exist for all six remote drivers: PostgreSQL,
MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis and ClickHouse. The runner enables these
ignored fixtures through the `drivers` layer. This is coverage inventory; the
current commit's hosted driver-layer result is tracked separately.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mysql --test integration backend_loss_during_row_stream_fails_the_whole_query_as_disconnected -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

### MySQL TLS error classification, 2026-09-30

The full TLS fixture exposed a second MySQL I/O classification case: SQLx wraps
rustls `InvalidCertificate(NotValidForName)` in an `InvalidData` I/O error, so
the mapper returned `Disconnected` for a certificate hostname mismatch. The
mapper now walks the I/O source chain and detects TLS failures before its
generic disconnection fallback. The regression asserts a wrapped TLS cause
stays `Tls`; ordinary EOF remains `Disconnected`, and connection refusal stays
`ConnectionRefused`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mysql --lib
rtk python3 scripts/run-test-layer.py tls
```

All 13 MySQL library tests passed. The complete TLS layer passed all 35
fixture tests, including the previously failing MySQL identity check. The
scoped mutation run caught 5 of 6 generated mutations; one was unviable:
`target/quality/20260930-mysql-tls-map-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
Layer evidence:
`target/quality/20260929T225302522187Z-layers/report.json`.

## MongoDB transport disconnect classification, 2026-09-30

A failing-first mapper test showed that MongoDB reset, EOF and broken-pipe
transport errors were surfaced as generic query errors. The mapper now returns
`Disconnected` for connection-aborted, reset, broken-pipe, unexpected-EOF and
not-connected I/O failures. Connection refusal remains distinct; TLS detection
still runs first, and unrelated I/O such as permission denial remains a query
error. A local unused-port test checks server-selection failures remain
`ConnectionRefused`; a Docker-backed wrong-password test verifies
`AuthFailed`. The Docker-backed server-loss contract connects and performs an
operation, stops MongoDB, and requires the next operation to return
`Disconnected`. It pins the container to a stable host port, restarts the same
container, and verifies the existing client can list collections again. The
stable port ensures recovery exercises the same endpoint.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --lib
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration an_unavailable_mongodb_server_is_classified_as_connection_refused -- --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration wrong_mongodb_credentials_are_classified_as_auth_failed -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration a_lost_mongodb_server_is_reported_as_disconnected -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

All 34 MongoDB library tests, the local refused-endpoint test, the Docker
authentication test and the server-loss classification test passed. The initial
same-client recovery attempt failed with a random mapped port. After reserving
and mapping a fixed host port, the focused contract passed in 6.84 seconds. The
server-loss test first failed because an established operation surfaced
`ConnectionRefused`; operations now map server-selection failures and transport
refusal to `Disconnected`, while connect-time refusal stays `ConnectionRefused`. The first
nine-mutant mapper run caught 6, missed
the untested authentication and server-selection branches, and found one
unviable mutation. Both missed branches now have regressions; separate targeted
mutation runs caught the authentication and server-selection mutants. Reports:
`target/quality/20260930-mongodb-disconnect-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
`target/quality/20260930-mongodb-auth-map-mutant/mutants.out/outcomes.json`, and
`target/quality/20260930-mongodb-selection-map-mutant/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

### MongoDB cancellation preserves client usability, 2026-10-01

A MongoDB 7 `failCommand` fixture blocks one `listCollections` command. The
test polls `currentOp` and confirms the command is active before cancelling,
then requires `OperationOutcomeUnknown(Cancelled)` and successfully lists
collections again through the same client. This verifies cancellation stays
distinct from disconnect and does not strand later operations.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration a_cancelled_mongodb_read_leaves_the_client_usable -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused Docker contract passed: 1 test, 26 filtered, in 0.92 seconds.

## Redis disconnect classification, 2026-09-30

A Docker-backed regression first connected and completed `PING`, stopped the
Redis server, then required a second command to fail as `Disconnected`. Before
the fix it returned a generic query error (`broken pipe`). Redis error mapping
now treats dropped connections, timeouts and I/O errors during established
operations as `Disconnected`; TLS and authentication checks still run first.
Connection refusal, reset and broken pipe during connection setup remain
`ConnectionRefused`, distinct from an established connection loss. The Docker
contract now restarts Redis and requires a fresh connection to complete `PING`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-redis --lib
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-redis --test integration a_lost_redis_server_is_reported_as_disconnected -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

All 37 Redis library tests and the Docker server-loss/restart test passed. The first
copy-based mutation attempt stopped during its clean baseline build because the
temporary filesystem quota was exhausted; it ran no mutants. An in-place scoped
run found two survivors caused by redundant checks: in redis 1.7, timeout and
dropped-connection predicates are both I/O errors, and `is_connection_dropped`
is already implied by `ErrorKind::Io`. The mapper now uses that single I/O-kind
contract. The final run caught 8 of 9 mutants; one was unviable, with no missed
or timed-out mutants. Reports:
`target/quality/20260930-redis-disconnect-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
`target/quality/20260930-redis-disconnect-mutants-inplace/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
and `target/quality/20260930-redis-disconnect-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The setup-time reset/broken-pipe regression failed before the mapper fix. A
targeted mutation run of the mapper caught 6 of 7 mutants; one was unviable,
with no missed or timed-out mutants:
`target/quality/20260930-redis-startup-disconnect-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

## PostgreSQL mid-stream disconnect completeness, 2026-09-30

A Docker-backed regression starts a 100-row query with a short delay per row,
waits until PostgreSQL reports its backend active, then terminates that backend
after row production has begun. The driver must return `Disconnected` for the
whole query rather than present any partial rows as a complete result. The same
pool must then complete `SELECT 1` successfully. This complements the existing
query-start termination and full-server restart cases. The focused integration
case passed locally: 1 test passed. The broader cross-driver mid-stream contract
remains open.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration disconnection::backend_loss_during_row_stream_fails_the_whole_query_as_disconnected -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

## ClickHouse disconnect classification, 2026-09-30

A Docker-backed regression completed `SELECT 1`, stopped ClickHouse, then
required a second query to return `Disconnected`. The test initially received
`ConnectionRefused`: the shared mapper classified network refusal as a
connection-setup error even for established queries. Error mapping now keeps
`ConnectionRefused` during connect and reports network loss during later
operations as `Disconnected`; TLS detection remains ahead of both paths.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --lib
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration a_lost_clickhouse_server_is_reported_as_disconnected -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

All 39 ClickHouse library tests and the Docker server-loss/restart test passed. The
first scoped mutation run found an uncovered distinction between setup-time
`connect error` and operation-time refusal. New mapper regressions cover both
forms, including refusal during an established operation. The rerun caught 4
of 5 mutants; one was unviable, with no missed or timed-out mutants. Reports:
`target/quality/20260930-clickhouse-disconnect-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`
and `target/quality/20260930-clickhouse-disconnect-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

### ClickHouse row-stream interruption completeness, 2026-09-30

Docker contracts stop ClickHouse while `sleepEachRow` produces a chunked result.
A forced stop must return `Disconnected`, never a partial `QueryResult`, and a
fresh driver connection must work after restart. Graceful shutdown follows a
different server path: ClickHouse 24.8 appends `QUERY_WAS_CANCELLED` as a
single-cell JSON row after already emitted data. Before the fix, the driver
returned those prior rows plus the exception text as a successful result. The
decoder now recognizes the server exception shape and returns a query error,
while the same message remains recognizable by the controlled-cancellation
path. A unit contract distinguishes that exception payload from ordinary text.
Both focused Docker cases and all 40 ClickHouse library tests passed. The
decoder's scoped mutation run caught all 11 generated mutants, with no missed,
timed-out or unviable mutants:
`target/quality/20260930-clickhouse-exception-row-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --lib tests::clickhouse_terminal_exception_row_is_an_error_not_partial_success -- --exact
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration disconnection::server_loss_during_row_stream_fails_the_whole_query_as_disconnected -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1

```

## SQL Server disconnect delivery, 2026-09-30

A Docker-backed test completes `SELECT 1`, stops the SQL Server container, then
requires the next query on the established connection to return `Disconnected`.
This confirms the driver does not surface server loss as a generic query error.
The test then restarts the same container, reconnects through the driver and
requires a fresh `SELECT 1` to succeed.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration a_lost_sql_server_is_reported_as_disconnected -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused SQL Server server-loss/restart test passed.

A second Docker contract interrupts a multi-result stream after its first row
set has arrived, while the server is in `WAITFOR`. SQL Server returns TDS error
596 (session is in the kill state) when the stream is drained. The mapper
previously surfaced this terminal session failure as an ordinary query error;
it now reports `Disconnected`. The test requires the query to fail as a whole,
then restarts SQL Server and verifies a fresh `SELECT 1`. A unit contract keeps
596 distinct from login failure and ordinary SQL errors. All 32 library tests
and the complete SQL Server integration suite passed (31 tests, including the
Docker cases; 147 seconds). The mapper mutation run caught both viable
match-arm mutations; one whole-function mutant was unviable, with no missed or
timed-out mutants:
`target/quality/20260930-mssql-terminal-session-map-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration server_loss_during_multi_result_stream_rejects_the_whole_query -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mssql --lib terminal_session_kill_is_disconnected_but_sql_errors_are_preserved
```

## Connect refusal versus established disconnect, 2026-09-30

Native-driver checks against unused local TCP ports cover PostgreSQL, MySQL,
SQL Server, ClickHouse, Redis and MongoDB. The PostgreSQL and MySQL checks first
failed: SQLx retries refused connections while creating a pool and eventually
returns `PoolTimedOut`, which the shared operation mapper classified as
`Disconnected`. Their setup paths now map that pool-startup failure to
`ConnectionRefused`, while `PoolTimedOut` from an established operation remains
`Disconnected`. Unit contracts assert both contexts, and the full driver
connect path verifies the observable result. MongoDB's pre-existing refused-
endpoint test supplies its native-driver check.

The focused checks passed for all five shared-helper callers; MongoDB's existing
unused-port test remains in the driver's integration suite. The initial failing
PostgreSQL and MySQL runs reproduced the incorrect `Disconnected` classification.
Scoped mutation runs caught both generated changes to the setup-time timeout
predicate in PostgreSQL and MySQL. An earlier PostgreSQL broad test run missed
the `true` mutant because no `PoolClosed` case distinguished a startup timeout;
the added unit case now catches it. The final PostgreSQL and MySQL predicate
runs each caught 2 of 2 mutants. The first function-wide mutation was unviable
because `DriverError` has no `Default`; the predicate-scoped reruns are the
retained mutation evidence:
`target/quality/20260930-pg-connect-refusal-predicate-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`
and `target/quality/20260930-mysql-connect-refusal-predicate-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-postgres --lib a_pool_startup_timeout_is_not_mapped_as_an_established_disconnect
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mysql --lib a_pool_startup_timeout_is_not_mapped_as_an_established_disconnect

rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mysql --test integration an_unavailable_mysql_server_is_classified_as_connection_refused -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

## Restart recovery across remote drivers, 2026-09-30

The PostgreSQL and MySQL pool tests stop and restart the server container while
keeping its mapped host port stable, then verify the existing pool reconnects
after reporting `Disconnected`. The MongoDB, Redis, ClickHouse and SQL Server
server-loss tests restart the same Docker container after checking
`Disconnected`, refresh the mapped host port, and establish a fresh connection
through the driver. A bounded shared
test helper retries only connection refusal, disconnection, timeouts and the
Redis startup broken-pipe case; each test still requires a protocol-level
operation to succeed. This proves explicit reconnect after restart; it does not
claim transparent recovery of the old connection handle.

The full Docker-backed driver layer passed 207 driver, MCP, PostgreSQL socket
and SSH tests after the restart and setup-refusal additions, with zero failures
in 864.5 seconds. The quick layer also passed after the SQLx mapping correction.
Reports:
[`20260930T021134930354Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T021134930354Z-layers/report.json)
and [`20260930T020929420585Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T020929420585Z-layers/report.json).

The integrated layer passed again on exact commit
`8680cc0d38a917218163eaf3ce9fe4b9c190a6da`: 930.5 seconds, exit code 0, clean
worktree. All six server-driver suites, the real-MongoDB MCP browse round trip,
Extended JSON BSON re-import, PostgreSQL socket tests and SSH fixtures passed;
no executed suite failed or ignored a test. The report and complete test log are
[`20260930T122803925695Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T122803925695Z-layers/report.json)
and [`drivers-1.log`](../target/quality/20260930T122803925695Z-layers/drivers-1.log).
`scripts/ci-local.sh integration` activates the ignored MCP fixture explicitly;
the direct rerun also passed:

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-mcp --test mongodb_extended_json -- --include-ignored --exact mongodb_extended_json_survives_the_mcp_query_tool_round_trip --test-threads=1
```

The real-server MCP test now independently reads the seeded document through
MongoDB's native driver before dispatch. It checks Decimal128, BSON DateTime,
user-defined binary subtype `80`, Int64 above 2^53, explicit NULL and Unicode,
then requires the MCP browse result to preserve the matching Extended JSON
markers and values. This distinguishes an exact MCP response from a fixture
that happened to contain only JSON lookalikes. The focused Docker test passed.

On September 30, the full Docker-backed `drivers` layer was rerun at source SHA
`8ed0f66ed54b1411feaac5d7a8e49abc6999fb18`. It ran 219 tests with zero failures
or ignored tests in the executed suites in 939.7 seconds. The six server-driver
disconnect and mid-stream/page-loss regressions passed, as did the pool/fresh
connection recovery paths, MCP, PostgreSQL socket and SSH checks. See
[`20260930T110146955489Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T110146955489Z-layers/report.json)
for the per-step report.

After splitting the nested MongoDB test into its own support module, the strict
shared value-contract runner passed with GTK and DuckDB enabled against base SHA
`736a73f8434a57fd33dbe9d6212956e29351b168`. It executed 144 tests across all 11
expected suites, reported no missing suites, and finished in 201.7 seconds.
Compilation found 746 fresh artifacts and rebuilt one package. The quick layer
then passed in 92.0 seconds, including file-size and function-size guards. See
[`20260930T114622059959Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T114622059959Z-layers/report.json),
[`20260930T114622117990Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T114622117990Z-values/report.json)
and [`20260930T114425279874Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T114425279874Z-layers/report.json).

Before the restart additions, an earlier source snapshot passed 200 selected
driver, socket and SSH tests and the strict shared-values layer passed 135 tests
with GTK and DuckDB enabled and no missing suites. That historical evidence is
retained here; the current 207-test driver and quick reports are above:
[`20260930T010431493880Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T010431493880Z-layers/report.json),

[`20260930T011850675572Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T011850675572Z-values/report.json),

## DuckDB duplicate result column names, 2026-09-28

A local `UNION ALL` result returns two columns with the same alias and two rows.
The contract asserts that both names remain `duplicate`, values stay in their
original columns and row order, and the result is not marked truncated. This
preserves the engine result shape without inventing unique aliases.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration query_preserves_duplicate_column_names_and_row_order -- --exact
```

The focused local DuckDB contract passed.

## DuckDB row-cap completeness, 2026-09-28

The local DuckDB result limit is checked at both boundaries. A query returning
exactly `MAX_QUERY_ROWS` preserves the first and last ordered values and reports
`truncated = false`; a query with one additional row still returns the capped
count and reports `truncated = true`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration query_marks_only_results_over_the_row_cap_as_truncated -- --exact
```

The focused local DuckDB contract passed.

## SQL Server multi-result draining, 2026-09-28

The SQL Server batch API represents one `QueryResult`, so the contract records
the supported behavior: return columns and rows from the first result set,
drain later sets, and report a server error raised after the first set instead
of silently returning success. A subsequent query verifies the connection
remains usable after the late error.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration an_error_raised_after_the_first_result_set_is_reported -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused SQL Server Docker contract passed.

## MongoDB page metadata and grid editability, 2026-09-30

MongoDB's `fetch_rows` returns page columns formed from the first-50 sample
and the current page; conflicting observed BSON kinds are labeled `mixed`.
The browse UI previously retained only the earlier `ColumnsLoaded` columns,
leaving grid factories and schema-dependent filters with stale metadata. It now
uses page columns for the active result, keeps the initial metadata for drivers
whose page results omit columns, and rebuilds factories when any `ColumnInfo`
changes, even when the column count is unchanged. This ensures mixed columns
remain read-only and late fields use their observed metadata. Schema discovery
for documents outside the sample and returned page is still not exhaustive.

The regression tests cover the Mongo page-schema handoff, preservation of
non-Mongo behavior and same-width type-change invalidation. A follow-up now
feeds the effective page schema into the actual cell editability predicate: a
text cell stays editable under the sampled string schema, but becomes read-only
when the current page reports `mixed`. The latest full app library run passed
411 tests (12 ignored). A scoped in-place mutation run against the page-schema
handoff caught all 3 viable mutations; 3 whole-function replacements were
unviable, with no survivors or timeouts.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-app --lib browse_tab::tests -- --nocapture

### MySQL malformed routine delimiter fails closed, 2026-09-30

An unterminated quote inside a `DELIMITER $$` routine must not expose the
trailing query as executable script. The editor contract requires a planner
diagnostic, execution planning refusal, no parameter extraction from the
malformed tail, source preservation through formatting and an `Unparseable`
write classification denied by the agent policy. The regression passed; no
planner or policy defect was found.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-app --lib malformed_mysql_delimited_routine_blocks_the_whole_script -- --test-threads=1
```

## MongoDB BSON kind matrix audit, 2026-09-30

The type matrix still listed unnamed top-level BSON kinds as open. The
exhaustive driver type-classification match and Extended JSON fallback were
compared with native grid fixtures: Timestamp, regex, JavaScript,
JavaScript-with-scope, Symbol, DbPointer, Undefined, MinKey and MaxKey all have
native keyed-edit assertions; binary subtypes and BSONColumn have dedicated
native checks, and scalar/container variants have driver value contracts. The
whole MongoDB integration suite passed all 26 tests, including ignored Docker
fixtures. The remaining MongoDB schema gap is collection-wide discovery beyond
the first-50 sample and current result page.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

## MongoDB nested-document grid edit, 2026-09-30

A Docker-backed app contract now takes a displayed nested document through the
MongoDB app parser, keyed update builder and driver, then reads it with a separate
native MongoDB client. The edited cell contains an Int64 above JavaScript's safe
integer boundary, a scale-preserving Decimal128, and an ObjectId inside the
nested document. The contract also checks the target `_id`, an untouched sibling
field and a second row's full contents. This joins the app/driver paths that had
previously only been covered separately by parser and BSON codec tests.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_mongodb_nested_document_edit_preserves_extended_bson_and_row_identity -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

The focused Docker test passed: 1 passed, 0 failed.

## Current corpus

The [type-contract strategy](type-contract-strategy.md) defines boundary families,
proof requirements and remaining driver targets. This status was reconciled through
`linux` commit `b2bc42729b145b91f0f75f8d40b3fa0a69e7a31d` on 2026-09-29. The
strict combined run passed with GTK and DuckDB enabled, including the app's
optional DuckDB parser/edit contract: all 11 selected crates passed 119
contracts, no suites were missing, 741 artifacts were fresh, and four packages
were rebuilt. The report records `dirty: false` and the exact commit:
`target/quality/20260929T063203554829Z-values/report.json`. This does not
establish complete native-type support or replace installed-app acceptance.

| Path | Assertions |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, ClickHouse, DuckDB | Bound parameters and generated SQL preserve signed integer limits, values around 2^53, small/large floats, text and NULL |
| Six SQL drivers, mixed named bindings | Repeated names, signed integer limits, empty text versus NULL, SQL-like Unicode payloads and placeholder-looking text retain type, position and exact content |
| Fixed-decimal SQL engines | Positive and negative decimals retain their value through binding and generated SQL; SQLite has no fixed-decimal storage contract |
| Redis | Integer command replies and quoted text arguments retain their values; a missing key differs from empty text; RESP3 hash maps preserve binary field values, nested structures use tagged JSON, and BigNumber digits remain exact |
| MongoDB | JSON commands preserve integer, float, text and NULL values through BSON and result decoding |
| Grid, filter, CSV and named parameter parsers | Integer overflow and decimal rounding are refused; representable boundaries survive parsing |
| Float input parsers | Numeric overflow to infinity and nonzero underflow to zero are refused |
| XLSX | Integers beyond 15 digits, exact decimals, and finite floats Excel may round or underflow are text cells; XML verifies values and cell types, while safe finite floats remain numeric |
| JSON and MCP | Non-finite values and negative zero remain distinct from SQL NULL and positive zero |

### Redis RESP3 nested values and binary replies

Top-level RESP arrays continue to produce one result row per item, and top-level
maps remain key/value rows. Nested arrays become JSON arrays, while nested maps
and sets carry `$redisMap` and `$redisSet` markers so their shape is explicit.
Invalid UTF-8 bulk strings inside nested values use a lowercase hex
`$redisBytes` marker; direct bulk values remain `Value::Bytes`. BigNumber uses
exact decimal text as a scalar and a `$redisBigNumber` marker when nested. A
separate boundary test builds a map one item beyond `MAX_QUERY_ROWS` and checks
that only the capped rows are returned with `truncated: true`.

The focused unit contract first failed against the previous decoder, which
returned Rust debug strings such as `array([binary-data(...)])`. The map cap
contract also caught a false-complete result before its fix. Unit tests also
check `$redisAttribute` and `$redisPush` markers; these prove conversion, not
live subscription behavior. All 34 Redis unit tests pass. A Redis 7.4 Docker
contract switches to RESP3, reads an HGETALL map with text and invalid UTF-8
values, then reads an XREAD stream response with nested values and binary data.
All 3 Redis Docker integration tests pass.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-redis --lib redis_nested_replies_keep_structure_and_binary_bytes
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-redis --test integration value_contract_resp3_hash_map_preserves_binary_fields_and_values -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The XREAD stream map/array response has real Redis 7.4 coverage. Attribute
wire framing is checked through a local RESP3 TCP fixture in addition to unit
conversion tests. Asynchronous push delivery is covered by explicit refusal for
streaming commands; other server push-frame delivery remains open.

### Redis Pub/Sub and MONITOR stream refusal, 2026-09-29

A Redis 7.4 Docker regression first demonstrated that `SUBSCRIBE` returned a
one-shot `$redisPush` subscription acknowledgement, although the request /
response API cannot deliver later message pushes. A second failing-first case
showed that `MONITOR` returns `OK` before switching into its continuous event
stream. `CLIENT TRACKING ON BCAST` likewise returned `OK` while enabling
invalidation pushes. The driver now refuses
`SUBSCRIBE`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `SSUBSCRIBE`, and their three unsubscribe commands
as `Unsupported` before sending them. It also refuses `MONITOR` and
`CLIENT TRACKING ON` with any trailing flags. The live contract exercises each
streaming command on one connection, checks the refusal explanation, then
confirms `PING`, `CLIENT TRACKING OFF`, `PUBLISH`, `PUBSUB CHANNELS` and
`CLIENT LIST` still work. This prevents a one-shot acknowledgement from
implying that an ongoing stream is being received while preserving adjacent
one-shot commands. It does not add a streaming API or establish live delivery
for other asynchronous pushes or attribute frames. The first scoped mutation
pass caught 2, left 2 missed and found one unviable whole-query replacement.
After adding live negative assertions, iteration caught both survivors:
cumulatively 4 caught, 1 unviable, no survivors or timeouts. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260929-redis-async-push-mutants/mutants.out.old/outcomes.json`
and `target/quality/20260929-redis-async-push-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The clean combined runner passed after the tracking-push addition at
`af46f18461e98a5ec83833e9c18556211b7f1b56`: 125 selected contracts across 11
suites, with no missing suites. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260929T191639404194Z-values/report.json` (`dirty: false`).

The command matrix now also covers `CLIENT TRACKING ON OPTIN NOLOOP`,
`CLIENT TRACKING ON REDIRECT 1`, and mixed-case `CLIENT TRACKING ON BCAST
NOLOOP`. The strict combined runner selected the ignored Redis Docker test and
passed all 127 contracts across 11 suites. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260929T195657915401Z-values/report.json` (`dirty: true`; the
test and ledger edits were present in the working tree during the run).

After the RESP3 wire contract was committed, the strict combined runner passed
all 128 contracts across 11 suites with no missing suites at
`887a1bd61060e5c604e9d4e52cb821de4dcf2202` (`dirty: false`). Both the stream
refusal contract and the attribute-wire contract appear as passed Redis tests.
Evidence: `target/quality/20260929T200632950370Z-values/report.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-redis --test integration value_contract_redis_stream_commands_are_refused_without_consuming_the_connection -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

### Redis RESP3 attribute wire framing

An unignored local TCP fixture switches the real redis client connection to
RESP3 with `HELLO 3`, then sends a wire-level attribute frame attached to
`PONG`. The driver returns the payload and TTL metadata in its tagged JSON
representation, verifying framing through the socket decoder and query
conversion. This is protocol-client evidence; the separate Docker fixture
continues to verify responses from Redis 7.4 itself.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-redis --test integration value_contract_resp3_attribute_wire_frame_survives_the_request_response_connection -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

## CSV negative-zero export/import, 2026-09-28

A focused core contract exports IEEE-754 negative zero as CSV, reads the result
back through the delimited-file reader and typed `DOUBLE PRECISION` cell parser,
then compares the imported float's bit pattern with the submitted value. The
independent `to_bits()` oracle distinguishes negative zero from positive zero.
The test passed; no production mismatch was found.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_csv_round_trip_preserves_negative_zero_bits
```

## CSV signed integer boundary export/import

The typed `BIGINT` CSV round trip covers `i64::MIN`, `i64::MAX`, and
`9007199254740993` (one above the exact-integer limit of binary64). It checks
both the emitted decimal digits and the exact imported `Value::Int` values.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_csv_round_trip_preserves_signed_integer_boundaries
```

The focused core test passed.

## CSV decimal scale export/import

A typed `DECIMAL(10,4)` CSV round trip preserves `12.3000` in the emitted
token and in the imported `Decimal` scale. The assertions compare the text
representation because numeric equality alone would treat `12.30` and
`12.3000` as equivalent.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_csv_round_trip_preserves_decimal_trailing_zeroes
```

The focused core test passed.

## JSON negative-zero consumer contract

The JSON exporter writes finite negative zero as the numeric token `-0.0`.
Parsing the exported document recovers the original IEEE-754 negative-zero
bits, while positive zero remains positive and SQL NULL remains JSON null.
This is a JSON writer and parser contract; it does not establish all JSON
number bit patterns.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_json_keeps_negative_zero_distinct_from_positive_zero_and_null
```

The focused core test passed.

A second typed CSV contract carries `NaN`, positive infinity, negative infinity
and NULL through default CSV export and `DOUBLE PRECISION` import. It checks the
exact emitted tokens, the imported NaN/infinity classifications and NULL variant.
The regression passed; no production mismatch was found.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_csv_round_trip_keeps_nonfinite_floats_distinct_from_null
```

The default CSV export and typed `DOUBLE PRECISION` import also preserve the
smallest positive subnormal (`f64::from_bits(1)`) exactly. The importer result is
compared by IEEE-754 bits; the focused regression passes with no production
mismatch. The largest finite `f64` also survives the default CSV export and
typed import with its exact bit pattern.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_csv_round_trip_preserves_smallest_subnormal_bits
```

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_csv_round_trip_preserves_largest_finite_float_bits
```

### Seeded finite float consumer parity

A deterministic xorshift corpus combines adjacent representable values, values
near the normal/subnormal boundary, and finite values spread across signs,
mantissas and exponents. All 262 values round-trip through default CSV export,
typed `DOUBLE PRECISION` import, and JSON export/parse with exact IEEE-754 bit
comparisons. The fixed seed makes failures repeatable without adding a test
dependency. The unignored core unit test passed; it samples finite values and
does not claim to exhaust all `f64` bit patterns.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_csv_and_json_round_trip_seeded_finite_float_bits
```

Spreadsheet-application import and other finite `f64` bit patterns remain open.

A typed `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` CSV contract starts with a timestamp at
`+05:30` and nine fractional digits. Default export normalizes it to the exact
UTC token, and typed import reproduces the identical UTC instant. This closes
one nanosecond/timezone consumer cell; broader cross-format temporal parity
remains open.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_csv_round_trip_preserves_timestamptz_nanoseconds
```

ClickHouse long-value reads are checked with a server-generated value. Oversized
inline SQL is required to return its explicit query-size error; the fixture does
not raise that server limit or accept a truncated success.

## PostgreSQL script consumer agreement, 2026-09-28

A local policy integration contract uses CRLF line endings and issue-shaped
comments before, between, inside and after two statements. The comments and a
quoted literal contain semicolons and placeholder-shaped text. The planner must
return exactly the SELECT then UPDATE; parameter extraction must retain only
`shown`, then `name` and `id`; formatting must preserve comment text and leave
the same executable statements in order. Policy classification must still see
SELECT then UPDATE, including the UPDATE target and WHERE clause. This verifies
consumer agreement for this PostgreSQL boundary without a live database; it
does not close the other dialects or delimiter edge cases.

Focused result:

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-policy --test administrative_dialects postgres_script_consumers_agree_across_crlf_comments_and_formatting -- --exact
```

The test passed. No production defect was exposed.

The editor also converts GTK's character offset to a UTF-8 byte offset before
asking the planner for a statement. A focused app regression places `東京` in
the first statement and positions the cursor at the start of the second; it
asserts the mapped byte offset and that the editor selects `SELECT 2`. The
conversion was already present inline, so this closes an evidence gap rather
than correcting a behavior mismatch.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib gtk_character_offset_after_multibyte_text_selects_the_following_statement -- --test-threads=1
```

The test passed.

A second app regression passes `SELECT :safe; SELECT 'unfinished :tail` through
the planner, execution splitter, parameter extractor, formatter and policy. The
planner reports an unterminated quote; the app rejects the entire script rather
than returning its valid prefix. Parameter extraction converts only `:safe`
and leaves the malformed suffix intact, the formatter retains that suffix, and
policy classifies the whole input as unparseable and write-capable. This closes
the malformed-tail contract for PostgreSQL only.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib malformed_tail_is_not_accepted_as_a_valid_script_prefix -- --test-threads=1
```

The test passed. No production defect was exposed.

## SQL Server GO consumer agreement, 2026-09-28

An app regression sends three statements through a SQL Server script with two
`GO` batch separators. Placeholder-shaped text and semicolons in each `GO`
comment must not become parameters. The planner and app splitter retain three
statements and `ContinueNextBatch`; the formatter preserves both separators and
comments; named-parameter extraction returns only `read`, `name`, `id` and
`last`; policy classification keeps SELECT/UPDATE/SELECT order and the UPDATE
WHERE fact. The contract uses the shared lexer and formatter without a live
SQL Server. Non-default MySQL delimiter forms remain open.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib mssql_go_batches_keep_consumer_order_and_ignore_delimiter_comments -- --test-threads=1
```

The test passed. No production defect was exposed.

## SQL Server repeated GO count refusal, 2026-09-28

The app contract feeds `GO 2` through the SQL Server script consumers. The plan
retains the repeat count, but execution planning refuses to run it instead of
silently running the batch once. Formatting keeps the directive and its comment;
parameter extraction returns only the SQL parameter, and policy classifies the
full repeated script as unparseable and write-capable. This proves safe refusal,
not repeated-batch execution support.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib mssql_go_repetition_is_preserved_and_refused_by_script_execution
```

The test passed; no production defect was found.

## SQL Server `datetime2(7)` 100-nanosecond result precision

The temporal fixture checks its `datetime2(7)` result directly:
`2024-01-02 03:04:05.1234567` decodes to a `NaiveDateTime` with
`123456700` nanoseconds, matching the independent server text from
`CONVERT(varchar(27), precise, 126)`. Its full source row also contains legacy
`datetime`, so SQL literal export must refuse that row rather than bypass the
decoder's `Undecodable` marker. A separate projection round-trips supported
`smalldatetime`, `datetime2(7)`, `time(7)` and `date` columns and compares native
server values. This verifies the seventh fractional digit through decoding and
SQL export; it does not claim coverage for all SQL Server temporal edge cases.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration inexact_legacy_datetime_refuses_sql_export_but_supported_temporals_round_trip -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The old integration assertion failed on `UnrepresentableValue { column: "legacy" }`,
which was the correct safety behavior. The regression now compares both
undecodable legacy cells with exact SQL Server text, requires export refusal for
the legacy column, and round-trips the remaining supported temporal projection.
The focused Docker test passed; no production mismatch was found.

### SQL Server `smalldatetime` rounding threshold

A focused server test checks values at the `smalldatetime` second-rounding
boundary. `03:04:29.998` decodes and renders as `03:04:00`; `03:04:29.999`
rounds to `03:05:00`. Each decoded `DateTime` is checked beside SQL Server's
independent style-126 text value. The Docker test passed with no production
mismatch; broader legacy temporal boundaries remain open.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration value_contract_smalldatetime_rounding_matches_server_text -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

### SQL Server legacy `datetime` tick boundaries

A SQL Server Docker contract checks legacy `datetime`
rounding around its 1/300-second tick boundaries (`.001`, `.002`, `.004`,
`.005`, `.008`). Tiberius exposes each 1/300-second tick through
`NaiveDateTime`, which truncates some values to integer nanoseconds. Every third
tick is exact in nanoseconds and remains a typed value; other non-NULL legacy
`datetime` values become `Undecodable("datetime")` instead of exposing an
editable approximation. SQL NULL stays `Value::Null`. The fixture checks each
result beside SQL Server's independent rounded text.
`smalldatetime` and `datetime2` continue to use typed values.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration value_contract_legacy_datetime_refuses_ticks_chrono_cannot_represent -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused SQL Server Docker contract passed. A codec unit contract also checks
both nullable legacy type identifiers and confirms `datetime2` remains exact.
The first combined value run caught that `DATETIMN` metadata is shared by
`datetime` and `smalldatetime`; refusal now keys off Tiberius's distinct
`ColumnData::DateTime` versus `SmallDateTime` variants. The failed run is retained
at `target/quality/20260929T062250469254Z-values/report.json`; the focused
smalldatetime regression passes after the correction.
The final codec predicate mutation run caught both polarity changes (2/2),
including treating every nullable temporal payload as inexact; evidence is at
`target/quality/20260929-mssql-legacy-datetime-mutants-precise/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

## SQL Server money float-decoding refusal

A Docker regression first reproduced SQL Server `money` as
`Float(123456789012345.67)` even though an independent server-side decimal text
cast returned `123456789012345.6789`. `smallmoney` also travels through the
TDS client's floating-point representation. Non-NULL `ColumnType::Money` returns
`Undecodable("money")`, and `ColumnType::Money4` returns `Undecodable("smallmoney")`.
Nullable `smallmoney` is `ColumnType::Money` because pinned Tiberius maps every
`VarLenType::Money` to `Money`, so that path returns `Undecodable("money")`.
NULL remains NULL. The result's separate decimal text oracles preserve the
server's exact values. This is a safe refusal, not exact `money` editing or
binding support. A second live row sets both native values to SQL NULL and
checks that the result cells stay `Value::Null`, separate from the undecodable
non-NULL row.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mssql --lib money_columns_refuse_float_decoding_but_preserve_null
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration value_contract_money_values_are_refused_but_server_nulls_remain_null -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused codec unit test and updated Docker integration test passed. The
strict combined runner also passed all 121 selected contracts on commit
`71813f8d2`; evidence is
[`20260929T162725389033Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260929T162725389033Z-values/report.json).

### SQL Server `sql_variant` metadata refusal

A SQL Server Docker regression first checks the native base type and exact
`CONVERT(varchar(40), value)` text for `bigint` value `9007199254740993`, which
is beyond binary64's exact-integer range. Selecting the `sql_variant` then
reproduced a panic in the pinned Tiberius TDS metadata parser's unimplemented
`SSVariant` branch. The driver now catches that specific dependency panic at
the result boundary, returns `DriverError::Unsupported`, and retires the
affected connection instead of reusing a partially consumed TDS stream. The
same behavior is checked for both a shared connection and an isolated session.
The value is still unsupported; this is safe refusal, not `sql_variant`
decoding or editing.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration sql_variant_result_is_refused_without_panicking_or_reusing_the_connection -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused SQL Server Docker contract passed. Exact decoding remains open
until Tiberius supports `SSVariant` metadata without panicking.

Scoped `cargo-mutants` testing of `variant_guard.rs` first found that a
mutation making the refusal classifier return `true` for every error survived.
Negative assertions for unrelated unsupported operations and server query errors
were added. The final run caught 7 mutations, had 1 unviable mutation, and had
no survivors or timeouts. The initial survivor and final report are retained at
`target/quality/20260929-mssql-variant-guard-mutants/` and
`target/quality/20260929-mssql-variant-guard-mutants-final/`.

```sh
rtk cargo mutants --package tablepro-driver-mssql --file crates/drivers/mssql/src/variant_guard.rs --test-tool cargo --timeout 30 --build-timeout 180 --output target/quality/20260929-mssql-variant-guard-mutants-final -- --lib variant_guard::tests
```

## MySQL DELIMITER consumer agreement, 2026-09-28

An app regression uses `DELIMITER $$` around a stored procedure, resets the
delimiter to `;`, then runs a parameterized SELECT. The planner and editor
splitter return the procedure followed by the SELECT and omit client directives
from executable SQL. Formatting retains both directives. Parameter extraction
ignores placeholder-shaped text in directive comments and in the procedure's
quoted literal, retaining only `after` from the SELECT. The policy parser marks
the procedure statement unparseable and write-capable, then classifies the
following query as SELECT; agent policy denies the unparseable procedure. This
verifies client-side delimiter handling, not that stored-procedure definitions
are executable through BookiE. Human handling of unparseable SQL remains
policy-config dependent.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib mysql_delimiter_directives_agree_across_script_consumers -- --test-threads=1
```

The test passed. No production defect was exposed.

A second app regression uses the alternate `//` delimiter around a routine with
both semicolons and placeholder-shaped text inside a quoted string. Planning,
editor splitting, formatting and parameter extraction preserve the routine and
trailing SELECT, while only `after` is extracted as a parameter. This covers
`$$` and `//`; other delimiter forms remain open.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib mysql_slash_delimiter_is_preserved_across_planner_editor_and_parameters -- --test-threads=1
```

The focused app regression passed.

Text cases include empty strings, numeric-looking strings, Unicode, apostrophes,
quotes, backslashes, line breaks and text beyond 256 KiB. Float assertions in the
SQL harness compare bit patterns. Existing driver tests still cover binary
exports, typed row identity, cancellation, metadata and other engine behavior.
The new suite supplements those tests.

This is a growing contract, not proof of every database type. PostgreSQL's other
unconstrained numeric edit boundaries and special numerics, JSON and other unsupported array element
types, array grid write-back beyond the verified built-in `integer[]` case,
finite calendars beyond the shared range, and interval consumer parity still need
focused cases. ClickHouse Int128/UInt128
now have local parser and real-server exact-text result, binding and SQL export/import contracts at signed and unsigned boundaries, plus Int128 and UInt128 grid-edit contracts.
Installed GTK/package SQLite grid acceptance, spreadsheet floating-point edges and
remaining transport/persistence adapters also need focused cases. Add a reproducer
before changing a decoder or parser. Never make
a failing exact-value case pass by converting both sides to floats or by treating
an unsupported result as NULL.

## Build reuse

Cargo already caches build artifacts in `target`. Preserve that directory and
keep the toolchain, feature selection, profile and compiler flags consistent.
Changes to a shared crate correctly rebuild its consumers. Different package
selections can produce different dependency features and build-dependency hashes;
that can rerun DuckDB's C++ build even when its own feature list is unchanged.
See [Cargo build cache](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-cache.html)
and [feature resolution](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-resolver-version-2).

Use the same flags for repeated value-suite runs. The report records compile
seconds, fresh artifacts and rebuilt packages, so cache reuse is measurable.
Changing the test filter with `--unit-only` does not change the compile graph.
The local integration runner also selects the six server driver packages in one
Cargo invocation, including MongoDB. The PostgreSQL socket fixture preserves
`RUSTUP_HOME` while isolating application state, avoiding a fresh toolchain
download into its temporary home.

A secondary compiler cache such as [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache)
can help when switching build configurations or rebuilding native code. It is
not installed or enabled by this change. It cannot avoid relinking changed code
or replace tests, and Rust incremental compilation affects what it can cache.
No existing artifacts are deleted and no global Cargo or desktop settings change.

## Measured checkpoint: 2026-09-26

The complete `--gtk --duckdb` suite passed twice after the fixes. Evidence:

- `target/quality/20260926T182536049588Z-values/report.json`: all 11 selected
  suites passed; 33.393 seconds compiling changed Rust code.
- `target/quality/20260926T182710143702Z-values/report.json`: unchanged rerun;
  all suites passed, 0.924 seconds in the build step, 745 fresh artifacts and
  zero rebuilt packages. Database startup and test execution still take time.

- `target/quality/20260926T184410518775Z-integration/report.json`: 93 server
  integration tests and two PostgreSQL socket tests passed.
- `target/quality/20260926T184128878545Z-full/report.json`: full local gate
  passed; Debian package validation skipped because `dpkg-deb` is unavailable.
- `target/quality/20260926T184028346457Z-values/report.json`: final parser
  refinement and runner timeout handling; all 11 suites passed.

After preserving `RUSTUP_HOME`, the socket fixture passed again with build
steps of 0.50 and 0.33 seconds and no toolchain download.

These runs used the dirty working tree based on `9b7a996ca`; these are local
implementation results, not qualification of a frozen release candidate.

## XLSX integer and decimal checkpoint

The regression first reproduced `i64::MIN` becoming `-9223372036854776000`
and a wide decimal becoming `100000000000000000000`. Exports now store
integers beyond 15 digits and every exact decimal as text. Smaller integers
remain numeric. Decimal scale survives; arithmetic on these text cells requires
explicit conversion, which can lose precision in the spreadsheet application.
The test opens the generated XLSX ZIP and checks cell references against their
exact shared strings, not just successful file creation. The shared value runner
picks up both workbook regressions automatically.

Excel documents its [15-digit precision limit](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/format-numbers-as-text).
Spreadsheet import and spreadsheet-application re-import contracts remain open.

### XLSX float precision and Excel-safe cell types, 2026-10-02

A failing-first workbook contract showed that finite `f64` values were always
written as numeric cells, including negative zero, subnormals and values with
more than Excel's 15 significant decimal digits. Excel documents both its
15-digit precision and numeric magnitude limits in its
[specifications](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/excel-specifications-and-limits).
The writer now keeps finite floats numeric only when their shortest decimal has
at most 15 significant digits and the magnitude is within Excel's supported
numeric range. Risky values use exact text cells, preserving the sign of
negative zero and the decimal needed to reconstruct the original float. This
trades spreadsheet arithmetic for exact value retention on those cells, matching
the existing text policy for wide integers and exact decimals.

Workbook XML tests cover both numeric range boundaries, ordinary safe numbers,
negative zero, the smallest subnormal, the adjacent value above 1.0, a 17-digit
float, and `f64::MAX`. The exact-text cases were numeric cells before the fix;
they now emit as shared-string cells, while safe values remain numeric cells.
BookiE has no XLSX importer and LibreOffice is unavailable in the local
verification environment, so application-specific formula/re-import behavior
remains unverified.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core --lib export::xlsx::tests::value_contract_workbook
```

The exact selectors and source SHA are retained with the current review evidence.

### XLSX nested Extended JSON consumer check, 2026-09-27

The workbook regression writes a nested value containing Decimal128, binary
subtype and millisecond-date Extended JSON markers. It inspects the generated
XLSX shared-string cell and confirms the markers remain in one exact text cell.
The focused regression and all 436 core library tests passed. At this
checkpoint, it verified the shared XLSX writer boundary. A later MongoDB 7
integration regression now exercises actual driver query results through XLSX;
see [MongoDB nested BSON and native boundary checkpoint](#mongodb-nested-bson-and-native-boundary-checkpoint).

Validation: 415 core tests, core/workspace Clippy, size guards and `cargo deny
check` passed. The full local gate passed at
`target/quality/20260926T195741317332Z-full/report.json` on the working tree
based on `49981d123`; Debian validation was skipped because `dpkg-deb` is
unavailable. The XLSX regression failed before the fix.

## PostgreSQL NUMERIC decoding checkpoint

The real-server regression first returned an undecodable marker for a 40-digit
NUMERIC. The decoder now reads the base-10000 wire groups directly and retains
the server scale. Exactly representable values remain Decimal; wider values,
longer fractions, NaN and infinities remain text. NULL stays separate.
Direct, bound and session queries are compared with PostgreSQL numeric-to-text
output, including positive/negative values, 1e1000 and 1e-1000. Unit cases
exercise maximum wire weight and scale, malformed lengths, invalid groups/signs,
and values whose nonzero digits would otherwise be truncated by scale.

This closes the scalar decode gap. Arbitrary-precision editing, numeric arrays
and every downstream consumer still need their own acceptance. The encoding
follows PostgreSQL [numeric_send](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_16_STABLE/src/backend/utils/adt/numeric.c).

Validation: all 45 PostgreSQL unit/integration tests passed. The full local gate
passed at `target/quality/20260926T202553866194Z-full/report.json` on the
working tree based on `28df4581c`; Debian package validation was skipped because
`dpkg-deb` is unavailable. No new dependencies were added.
The all-eight-driver suite also passed at
`target/quality/20260926T202754372916Z-values/report.json`: all 11 selected
suites, including both PostgreSQL cases and eight core cases.

## PostgreSQL wide NUMERIC grid edit

The keyed-update builder binds a text-backed PostgreSQL `NUMERIC` edit through
`text` to the fixed `pg_catalog.numeric` type. Its unit contract covers a
`NUMERIC(80,40)` value with 40 integer digits and 40 fractional digits, beyond the
shared Decimal representation. Type metadata is matched against a numeric-only
grammar and never copied into SQL; ordinary text columns keep their existing
placeholder. The real-server contract compares the saved value with PostgreSQL's
own `numeric::text` output and passed against the Docker PostgreSQL fixture.

The focused core tests passed:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core --lib postgres_numeric -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core --lib postgres_wide_numeric -- --test-threads=1
```

The mapped change-contract gate also passed its four keyed-update regressions at
`target/quality/20260928T121821319834Z-change-contracts/report.json`.

The server test is discoverable as
`wide_numeric_contract::value_contract_wide_numeric_grid_edit_preserves_exact_value`.
The first run exposed two fixture mismatches: the temporary table was invisible to
pooled connections, and browse primary-key metadata was absent. After fixing those,
the server equality assertion passed. The `NUMERIC(1000,1000)` boundary contract
also passed against PostgreSQL, comparing the saved value to the server's
`numeric::text` output after a keyed grid update:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration wide_numeric_contract::value_contract_max_precision_numeric_grid_edit_preserves_exact_value -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

An app-parser regression then reproduced that the same `NUMERIC(80,40)` and
`NUMERIC(1000,1000)` inputs failed as `Invalid decimal` before reaching the grid
update builder. The PostgreSQL-only parser now retains a grammar-checked numeric
literal as exact text when `rust_decimal` cannot represent it; representable
values still use `Value::Decimal`. Its `NUMERIC(80,40)` case passes the parsed
value through the keyed-update builder and verifies the static
`$1::text::pg_catalog.numeric` cast. It rejects malformed input, and MySQL's
wide-numeric parser behavior is unchanged. Local app tests pass. PostgreSQL's
Docker composition test now uses the real app parser output, keyed-update
builder and PostgreSQL driver against both `NUMERIC(80,40)` and unconstrained
`numeric`, then compares each saved value to the server's independent
`numeric::text` output. The unconstrained case uses a 40-digit integer and
40-digit fraction, outside `rust_decimal` precision. The same app test sends an
unconstrained numeric at PostgreSQL's maximum fractional scale of 16,383 digits
and at its maximum integer width of 131,072 digits through the parser and keyed-
update builder. The server confirms exact `numeric::text` values, the fractional
scale, and the integer text length. Both unconstrained numeric width boundaries
are covered; other text-backed PostgreSQL types remain open. See
[PostgreSQL numeric type limits](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/datatype-numeric.html).

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib postgres_numeric_parser_outputs_round_trip_through_server -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

The test passed against the PostgreSQL 16 Docker fixture.

A separate PostgreSQL 16 contract covers a custom domain over `numeric`. The
40-digit integer/20-digit fraction remains exact in the domain result and the
server's `numeric::text` oracle; SQL-literal re-import and an explicitly typed
text binding also return the same value. This establishes the numeric-domain
cell, not broad domain, enum, composite or range support.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration wide_numeric_contract::value_contract_numeric_domain_preserves_wide_value_across_consumers -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL Docker test passed.

A second domain contract uses PostgreSQL's `uuid` base type. The direct domain
result remains `Value::Uuid`; an independent `uuid::text` value and
`pg_typeof` name confirm the native value/type. SQL-literal re-import and a
typed UUID parameter also produce the exact text. This closes one non-numeric
domain consumer case only.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_uuid_domain_preserves_uuid_across_consumers -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL JSONB domain and JSON null

A custom domain over `jsonb` preserves JSON null as `Value::Json(Null)` while a
SQL NULL of the same domain remains `Value::Null`. PostgreSQL independently
confirms the domain type, `jsonb_typeof`, and `IS NULL` results. SQL-literal
re-import and a typed JSON binding retain JSON null; a typed SQL NULL binding
remains SQL NULL. This closes one JSON-domain value/consumer cell without
claiming broad nonnumeric-domain coverage.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_jsonb_domain_keeps_json_null_distinct_from_sql_null -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.
The full PostgreSQL Docker integration suite passed (56 tests) on the current
worktree; this is local evidence, not hosted CI evidence.

### PostgreSQL `bit varying` exact text consumers

A PostgreSQL 16 contract exposed that the driver returned `Undecodable("VARBIT")`
for a valid 80-bit value even though PostgreSQL's text, bit count and equality
oracles agreed. The binary decoder now validates the declared bit count, packed
byte length and unused low padding bits, then renders every bit in order so
leading zeroes remain exact. The result, SQL-literal re-import and typed text
binding all preserve the same 80-bit string.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --lib bit_strings_keep_leading_zeroes_and_reject_malformed_wire_values
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_varbit_preserves_leading_zero_bits_across_consumers -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

Both the decoder unit test and PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL `macaddr` exact text consumers

A live PostgreSQL probe showed that the six-byte `macaddr` binary value was
returned as `Undecodable("MACADDR")` even though its server text and
`macaddr_send` wire bytes were exact. The driver now renders the six octets as
PostgreSQL's lowercase colon-separated text and rejects malformed byte counts.
The result, SQL-literal re-import and typed text binding preserve
`08:00:2b:01:02:03`; this contract covers `macaddr`, not `macaddr8`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --lib macaddr_requires_six_bytes_and_uses_postgres_lowercase_text
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_macaddr_preserves_exact_text_across_consumers -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

Both focused checks passed against the unit decoder and PostgreSQL 16 Docker
fixture.

### PostgreSQL `macaddr8` exact text consumers

The first PostgreSQL 16 Docker run confirmed the result consumer returned
`Undecodable("MACADDR8")` while `pg_typeof`, `::text`, and `macaddr8_send`
independently agreed on the eight-byte EUI-64 value. The binary decoder now
renders exactly eight octets in PostgreSQL's lowercase colon-separated form
and rejects malformed wire lengths. Result decoding, SQL-literal re-import,
and typed text binding preserve `08:00:2b:ff:fe:01:02:03`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --lib macaddr8_requires_eight_bytes_and_uses_postgres_lowercase_text
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_macaddr8_preserves_eui64_text_across_consumers -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The unit decoder and PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed. The baseline Docker
run reproduced the undecodable result while PostgreSQL's native type, exact
text, and eight-byte wire oracle agreed.

### PostgreSQL `inet` and `cidr` consumer parity

A focused PostgreSQL 16 contract distinguishes an IPv6 `inet` host address with
a `/64` mask from the corresponding canonical `cidr` network. Independent
`host`, `network`, `masklen`, `pg_typeof`, and `::text` results confirm the
address-versus-network semantics. Both values survive SQL-literal re-import
and typed text binding with their exact prefixes.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_inet_and_cidr_preserve_ipv6_prefix_semantics -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL maximum `pg_lsn` consumer parity

The PostgreSQL 16 contract covers `FFFFFFFF/FFFFFFFF`, the maximum unsigned
64-bit LSN. Server `pg_lsn::text`, `pg_lsn_send` bytes, type metadata and
equality confirm the exact value; direct result decoding, SQL-literal
re-import and typed text binding all retain the same uppercase segment text.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_pg_lsn_maximum_preserves_text_and_wire_identity -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL `int4range` explicit refusal

The PostgreSQL 16 contract checks a native `[1,5)` range against the server's
exact `int4range::text`, lower/upper bounds, and endpoint-inclusion functions.
The driver returns `Undecodable`; SQL-literal rendering and parameter binding
refuse that value rather than flattening range semantics into text.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_int4range_is_explicitly_unsupported -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL Docker contract passed. This is an explicit refusal
boundary, not support for PostgreSQL range values.

### PostgreSQL `int4multirange` metadata boundary

PostgreSQL 16 server-side projections independently confirm the native type,
exact `{[1,3),[5,8)}` text, `[1,8)` range hull, and two component ranges. A
direct multirange projection currently fails before BookiE receives a value:
SQLx metadata resolution rejects PostgreSQL's `typtype` code `m`. The contract
records this upstream decoding blocker; it does not claim a BookiE `Undecodable`
value or SQL-literal/binding refusal because no `Value` is produced. A separate
SQL boolean confirms SQL NULL remains null without projecting the multirange.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_int4multirange_metadata_resolution_failure_is_explicit -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed with that metadata error.

The companion contract now covers the five remaining built-in multirange types:
`int8multirange`, `nummultirange`, `datemultirange`, `tsmultirange` and
`tstzmultirange`. PostgreSQL independently returns each type name, canonical
text, merged hull and component count. SQLx rejects direct projection of every
type with the same unsupported `typtype` metadata error, and a separate
`IS NULL` check confirms SQL NULL remains observable. Together with the
`int4multirange` contract, the suite now records the limit for all six built-in
multirange types without claiming support or replacing native server oracles
with client formatting.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_remaining_builtin_multiranges_fail_explicitly_with_native_oracles -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed. Direct support remains open
until SQLx can resolve PostgreSQL multirange metadata safely.

### PostgreSQL composite explicit refusal

A PostgreSQL 16 fixture defines `(id bigint, label text)` and returns a value
containing `9007199254740993` and `東京`. PostgreSQL's `row_to_json`, type name,
and individual field expressions provide exact independent oracles. The
composite result is `Undecodable`; SQL-literal rendering and parameter binding
refuse it instead of flattening its structure.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_composite_result_is_explicitly_unsupported -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL Docker contract passed. This does not add composite
support.

### PostgreSQL temporal range explicit refusal

The PostgreSQL 16 contract returns a `tstzrange` spanning two fractional-second
instants supplied at `+02`, with UTC fixed for independent text oracles. The
driver marks the range `Undecodable`; server `tstzrange::text`, lower/upper
`timestamptz::text`, type name, and endpoint-inclusion functions confirm the
stored bounds and `[)` semantics. SQL-literal rendering and parameter binding
refuse the result. This adds one temporal range refusal boundary and does not
add PostgreSQL range support.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_tstzrange_is_explicitly_unsupported -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL built-in range family refusal

A PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract checks `daterange`, `numrange`, `tsrange` and
`int8range`. Each native result is `Undecodable`, while independent server
oracles verify the type name, canonical `::text`, lower and upper values, and
endpoint inclusivity. SQL-literal rendering and typed parameter binding refuse
each result, so these values are not flattened into lossy text. The existing
`int4range` and `tstzrange` tests retain their more detailed boundary coverage.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contracts::value_contract_builtin_range_families_are_refused_without_losing_native_text -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL scalar enum label text projection

A PostgreSQL 16 contract defines labels `NULL`, `東京`, and `o'brien`. For
each label, PostgreSQL's `pg_typeof` confirms the source expression remains the
custom enum while `enum::text` returns the exact label; SQL-literal re-import
and an explicitly typed text parameter also preserve it. SQL NULL is checked
separately from the literal label `NULL`. At this October 2 checkpoint,
directly returning the enum-typed column failed during SQLx type metadata
resolution (`enum_labels`:
unexpected NULL), so direct decoding remained open at that checkpoint. The
October 3 support that resolved it is recorded below.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contracts::value_contract_scalar_enum_labels_preserve_exact_text -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The strict value layer passed this contract against PostgreSQL 16. It now
exercises direct projection as well: with the pinned SQLx version, the query
returns `enum_labels: unexpected NULL` during metadata resolution. The test
asserts that exact failure boundary; if SQLx begins decoding the type, it instead
requires all three labels and SQL NULL to arrive exactly. This is a tested
metadata boundary, not exact typed support or a BookiE `Undecodable` value.
The clean GTK+DuckDB value runner passed 185 selected tests across 11 suites
with no missing suites on `e704831`; its
[layer report](../target/quality/20261002T001913901283Z-layers/report.json)
and [suite details](../target/quality/20261002T001913960449Z-values/report.json)
record this regression.

### PostgreSQL custom enum array metadata boundary

At this October 2 checkpoint, a PostgreSQL 16 fixture defined enum labels
`NULL`, `東京`, and `o'brien`, then built an array containing all three labels
plus SQL NULL. Server-side scalar projections confirmed the exact native array
type, PostgreSQL array text, and JSON semantics. Selecting the enum array itself
failed during SQLx metadata resolution (`enum_labels`: unexpected NULL); it did
not produce a BookiE `Undecodable` value. This recorded the open decoder/dependency
boundary before the October 3 SQLx parser fix below.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration array_contract::value_contract_custom_enum_array_projection_is_rejected -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The PostgreSQL 16 contract passed: independent server projections succeeded,
and direct enum-array projection returned the expected metadata error.

### PostgreSQL direct custom-enum result follow-up (October 3)

The current tree adds direct scalar and array decoding for ordinary custom enum
labels. A PostgreSQL 16 test checks `ready`, `paused`, SQL NULL, the native
`pg_typeof` text, and the exact array text `{"ready","paused",NULL}`. The
decoder uses the enum's UTF-8 wire label and quotes each array label so a SQL
NULL element remains distinct. Before the fix, the scalar labels were
`Undecodable`; the retained before-fix output is in
[`before-fix.txt`](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/before-fix.txt).

At this original October 3 decoder checkpoint, the adversarial scalar fixture
whose enum label is literally `NULL` still surfaced SQLx's metadata resolution
error (`enum_labels: unexpected NULL`), and keyed-edit proof remained open.
  The later October 3 support and write follow-up below supersedes that status.
The historical sections above retain their original checkpoint results.

### PostgreSQL enum literal-NULL result support (October 3)

SQLx's PostgreSQL text-array decoder removed element quotes, then treated any
resulting string equal to `NULL` as SQL NULL. The local SQLx 0.9.0 patch now
tracks whether an element was quoted. Its unit regression distinguishes quoted
`"NULL"`, unquoted SQL NULL, lowercase `null`, empty text and ordinary text.
Native Bookie scalar and array projections preserve the enum label `NULL`; a
native `UPDATE ... RETURNING` stores that label and fires its trigger once.
Schema-aware keyed updates and draft inserts also preserve it separately from
SQL NULL. Automatic parameter typing and the remaining enum consumer matrix
remain open under ADR 0007. Current source fingerprints and native results are
in the [enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

### PostgreSQL custom-enum structured filters (October 3)

Structured browse filters previously emitted `status = $1` for a custom enum
while binding `$1` as text. A PostgreSQL 16 regression first failed with
SQLSTATE 42883 (`enum = text`). The filter builder now uses fetched,
schema-qualified enum metadata to cast values for equality, inequality, range,
`BETWEEN`, and `IN`/`NOT IN` comparisons. The native fixture checks equality
and inequality for literal label `NULL`, a Unicode `IN` match, enum ordering
through `BETWEEN`, and `IS NULL` independently. Results include native type
oracles; explicit enum `NULL` and SQL NULL remain distinct. The text-pattern
filter path retains its text cast behavior.

The core unit suite passed 502 tests and the PostgreSQL integration suite passed
74 tests. Workspace Clippy, file/function/panic/bounded-operation guards,
formatting and diff checks passed. The initial failures and complete local test
outputs are retained in the
[enum evidence directory](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/). At this
checkpoint automatic parameter inference and enum import/export/MCP consumers
were still open; the following section closes the named CSV import path.

### PostgreSQL custom-enum CSV import (October 3)

The CSV import plan initially emitted an untyped placeholder for a custom enum
column, even though it bound the row as text. The native PostgreSQL regression
first failed with a plan lacking the schema-qualified enum cast. The plan now
uses catalog metadata to cast the text parameter through the enum type.

The default CSV exporter writes both an empty enum label and SQL NULL as a blank
field. Because that file cannot distinguish the two values, the importer now
refuses blank cells for PostgreSQL enum columns when the NULL marker is empty.
The native contract verifies the target remains unchanged after refusal. With
an explicit `\N` marker, the same importer preserves an empty label, literal
`NULL`, Unicode, apostrophe and comma labels, and SQL NULL; PostgreSQL type and
value oracles confirm the restored rows.

The core unit suite passed 504 tests and the PostgreSQL integration suite passed
75 tests. Workspace Clippy, formatting, guards, ignored-test inventory and diff
checks passed. The first failure, result logs and fingerprints are in the
[enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).
Other export encodings, automatic parameter inference and enum JSON/MCP
consumers remained open at this CSV checkpoint; the shared JSON renderer case
is covered in the following section. Automatic parameter inference and MCP delivery remain
open.

### PostgreSQL custom-enum JSON rendering (October 3)

A PostgreSQL 16 integration contract projects an enum column containing the
literal label `NULL`, an empty label, Unicode, and SQL NULL, and checks the
server-reported enum type for every row. The shared `render_json` serializer preserves the
labels as JSON strings, including `"NULL"` and `""`, while SQL NULL becomes
JSON null. The focused native selector passed; current source and output hashes
are recorded in the [enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

This proves the shared row-to-JSON result rendering for this PostgreSQL enum case.
MCP transport serialization, the file-writer path, automatic parameter
inference and other enum consumer/configuration combinations remain open under
ADR 0007.

### PostgreSQL custom-enum parameter type inference (October 3)

The native query/write contract first failed with SQLSTATE 42883 because a
custom enum comparison received a `TEXT` parameter. PostgreSQL now describes
parameter types from SQL context before binding text and SQL NULL values. When
the server infers a custom enum type, Bookie binds the original text bytes or
SQL NULL with that enum OID. If the SQL leaves the parameter ambiguous, the
driver retains the existing `Value` type; a plain text parameter remains TEXT.

The PostgreSQL 16 regression checks an enum label `NULL`, a SQL NULL match, a
direct update, a transactional update, an invalid label rejected with SQLSTATE
22P02, and an ordinary text parameter. Native `pg_typeof` and row postconditions
verify stored values and types. The before-fix `enum = text` failure and
after-fix focused result are recorded in the [enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

This closes text/SQL NULL inference where the server can determine a custom
enum parameter from the expression context. Other dynamic parameter types,
MCP delivery, the file-writer path, and additional enum configurations remain
open under ADR 0007.

### PostgreSQL custom-enum MCP and file export delivery (October 3)

A PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract sends enum rows through the production driver,
`McpBridge`, and the `execute_query` tool dispatcher. The fixture includes the
literal label `NULL`, an empty label, Unicode, and SQL NULL. The `execute_query`
response asserts exact JSON values, column order, non-truncated delivery, and
the server-reported `mcp_enum.state` type for every row. The same fixture checks
`export_data` JSON against those values and pins CSV output, where empty text is
quoted as `""` and SQL NULL is an unquoted blank. That CSV encoding is not a
lossless import promise: PostgreSQL enum import refuses ambiguous default blank
cells unless given a compatible explicit null marker. The core result-file writer
produces JSON preserving all four values and CSV with the same quoted-empty vs
blank-NULL convention. A cancellation after the first row preserves the previous
JSON destination and leaves no staging file. XML, HTML, and Markdown output now
have native enum contracts below; XLSX remains open under ADR 0007.

The ignored Docker selector, focused result, full PostgreSQL suite, and current
source/evidence hashes are recorded in the [enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

### PostgreSQL custom-enum SQL file export restore (October 3)

A PostgreSQL 16 fixture exports custom-enum query rows through the core SQL
result-file writer, then replays each generated INSERT into a destination with
the same enum type. The native postcondition checks `pg_typeof` and exact values
for literal `NULL`, an empty label, Unicode, SQL NULL, and an apostrophe/
semicolon label shaped like a `DROP TABLE` statement. The destination table and
all five rows survive with the original values. The focused Docker contract and
complete PostgreSQL integration suite passed. XLSX enum file-writer behavior
remains open; this case does not establish generic
SQL export compatibility across unrelated destination schemas. See the
[enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

### PostgreSQL custom-enum XML file export (October 3)

A PostgreSQL 16 fixture sends custom-enum results through the core XML
file-writer. Native query assertions verify the server-reported enum type and
exact labels for literal `NULL`, empty text, Unicode, a markup-shaped label,
and SQL NULL. The output keeps empty text distinct from the explicit null
element and escapes markup, quotes, apostrophes, and entity text so a label
cannot create elements or be normalized into a different literal. The focused
Docker contract passed. XLSX remains a separate consumer;
this XML encoding is not an import/restore contract. See the
[enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

### PostgreSQL custom-enum HTML file export (October 3)

A PostgreSQL 16 fixture sends enum results through the core HTML file-writer.
Native rows verify exact labels and `pg_typeof` for literal `NULL`, empty text,
Unicode, a hostile image/event-handler label, and SQL NULL. The HTML keeps the
three null/empty/text outcomes distinct and escapes the hostile label as text,
with no raw image element emitted. The focused Docker contract passed. XLSX
remains a separate consumer; HTML output is not an import/restore
contract. See the [enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

### PostgreSQL custom-enum Markdown file export (October 3)

A PostgreSQL 16 fixture sends custom-enum rows through the core Markdown
file-writer. Native row assertions verify `pg_typeof` and exact values for
literal `NULL`, empty text, Unicode, a pipe and newline, entity-looking text,
and SQL NULL. The initial export printed both the text label `NULL` and SQL
NULL as `NULL`; the retained before-fix output records that collision. Markdown
text cells now use JSON string quoting, while SQL NULL remains the unquoted
`NULL` marker. Cell characters that can split the table, form inline markup, or
look like HTML entities are escaped. The focused core and PostgreSQL tests
passed, followed by the complete PostgreSQL suite. Markdown output is an
explicit text encoding, not an import/restore contract. See the
[enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

### PostgreSQL custom-enum XLSX file export (October 3)

A PostgreSQL 16 fixture verifies exact enum labels and `pg_typeof` for literal
`NULL`, Unicode, entity-looking text, formula-shaped text, SQL NULL, and an
empty label. Non-empty results produce an XLSX package; the core workbook test
checks that text labels, including `NULL` and `=1+1`, are stored as shared-string
cells, XML-sensitive characters remain text, and SQL NULL has no string cell.
The native fixture confirms that an empty enum label is refused at its exact
one-based row and column and that the existing workbook remains unchanged with
no staged file left behind. The XLSX format therefore supports the tested
non-empty enum labels as text and explicitly refuses empty enum labels; this is
not a general workbook import/restore claim. See the
[enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

### PostgreSQL money safe refusal

A PostgreSQL 16 contract returns a native `money` value with a separate exact
`money::numeric::text` oracle and server equality check. The driver reports
non-NULL money as `Undecodable`, SQL-literal and parameter consumers refuse the
marker, and SQL NULL remains `Value::Null`. This is an explicit safety boundary,
not exact money support.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_postgres_money_is_refused_with_exact_server_oracle -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL geometric types: exact server oracle and visible refusal

A PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract checks the built-in `point`, `line`, `lseg`,
`box`, `path`, `polygon` and `circle` types. For each type, PostgreSQL supplies
an independent `pg_typeof` and `::text` oracle. Direct projections return the
matching `Undecodable` marker; SQL-literal and parameter consumers refuse that
marker. A separate NULL projection for every type remains `Value::Null`.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_geometric_types_keep_native_oracles_when_projection_is_refused -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL Docker contract passed. The strict combined runner also
passed at `ab6c38442dbc5ef6f3a4d7e477df97dcb7b3a411`: 124 selected contracts
across 11 suites, with no missing suites. Report:
`target/quality/20260929T165940977032Z-values/report.json`. This establishes
explicit safe refusal, not geometry editing or exact shared-type support.

### PostgreSQL `citext` text consumer contract

The PostgreSQL 16 fixture creates the `citext` extension and checks that a
mixed-case address remains byte-for-byte text through result decoding, SQL
literal re-import and a typed parameter. A separate comparison against the
lowercase spelling confirms PostgreSQL still applies `citext`'s
case-insensitive comparison semantics. This establishes the label's text
fidelity without claiming that `citext` semantics are represented by `Value`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_citext_preserves_label_and_case_insensitive_comparison -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL keyed-update cast and parser mutation checkpoint, 2026-09-28

The shared keyed-update builder's final focused mutation report selected 16
mutations: 14 were caught, two were unviable compilation changes, and none
survived or timed out. A surviving `&& -> ||` mutation had shown that a typed
`Value::Decimal` could incorrectly receive the text cast. The new unit regression
requires typed numeric binds to keep `$1` and their native decimal parameter;
the same core suite also checks safe metadata handling at and beyond the 64-byte
allowlist input limit.

The app-parser check adds malformed-literal refusals to the wide numeric parser
contract. A fresh in-place run generated 28 mutations: 17 were caught, nine
survived and two cursor-increment mutations timed out. The survivors showed that
the existing wide decimal had both integer and fractional digits, leaving
integer-only, fractional-only and exponent paths unasserted. The parser
regression now checks all three with values too large for `rust_decimal`; the
updated run caught eight previously missed mutations. One prior survivor and
the two prior timeouts now all time out because `+=` to `*=` prevents cursor
advancement inside digit-scanning loops. These are non-terminating mutated
scanners, not surviving valid-input behavior; the 30-second mutant timeout
stopped each run. There are no surviving mutants. No production behavior changed.

```sh
rtk cargo mutants --dir . --package tablepro-core --file crates/core/src/sql_dialect.rs --re 'build_keyed_update|postgres_numeric_cast_type' --test-tool cargo --timeout 30 --build-timeout 120 --output target/quality/20260928-pg-keyed-update-cast-final -- --lib
rtk cargo mutants --in-place --dir . --package tablepro-app --file crates/app/src/ui/browse_tab/value_parse.rs --re 'is_postgres_numeric_literal' --test-tool cargo --timeout 30 --build-timeout 120 --iterate --output target/quality/20260929-pg-numeric-parser-resume-inplace -- --lib postgres_
```

Reports: `target/quality/20260928-pg-keyed-update-cast-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`
and `target/quality/20260928-pg-numeric-parser-resume-inplace/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The updated parser regression passed, and the PostgreSQL Docker acceptance
contracts remain a separate server-side check.

### PostgreSQL NUMERIC special-value grid edit

The app's regular decimal parser rejects `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`.
Inline editing now keeps those three spellings as `Value::Text` only for the
PostgreSQL driver and decimal/numeric columns. The existing keyed-update builder
binds the text through `text` to the static `pg_catalog.numeric` target. The app
parser regression and PostgreSQL 16 integration case pass. The integration updates
one numeric column with each value and compares both decoded results and stored
values with the server's independent `amount::text` oracle. The app parser to
PostgreSQL composition test also parses each special spelling, applies the
keyed grid update, then compares the decoded value and `amount::text` result.

Focused checks:

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib postgres_numeric_specials_remain_exact_text_only_for_postgres -- --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration wide_numeric_contract::value_contract_numeric_special_grid_edits_match_server_text -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib postgres_numeric_parser_outputs_round_trip_through_server -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

The composed parser-to-server test passed against the PostgreSQL 16 Docker fixture.

## PostgreSQL array checkpoint

Scenario B3-1 follows the DBeaver array distinctions recorded in the
[external survey](b3-test-scenario-survey.md). The first real-server regression
failed on an empty int4 array, which returned Undecodable. No external fixture
or source code was copied.

The driver now decodes binary arrays of bool, int2/int4/int8, oid, text/name/
varchar/bpchar, float4/float8, numeric, UUID and bytea. IPv6 `inet[]` remains
an explicit safe refusal even though PostgreSQL's type, text, JSON and element
oracles are covered. Results use PostgreSQL array
text in Value::Text and retain the original array type in ColumnInfo. Whole-array
NULL remains Value::Null. Nested braces and explicit bounds preserve dimensions;
quoted elements distinguish NULL, literal NULL, empty strings and escaped text.
JSON export retains this text representation, not a flattened JSON array.

The regression compares PostgreSQL array_send bytes after SQL literal re-import,
explicitly typed parameter binding and execution of generated INSERT exports.
It also checks session/direct parity, exact column type and JSON string fidelity.
The corpus includes six dimensions, non-default lower bounds, Unicode, quotes,
backslashes, newline and SQL-shaped text, numeric scale/wide fractions, signed
zero, NaN/infinities, empty binary values and integer boundaries.

Unit tests reject truncated/trailing data, invalid dimensions or element lengths,
OID mismatches, invalid UTF-8 and NULL flags, unsupported element types and
size/product overflow. Deterministic malformed-input and header-mutation cases
exercise bounded decoding. Binary-to-text array decoding is capped at 16 MiB; exceeding the
limit returns the existing visible undecodable marker rather than truncated data.

Limits: network, enum/domain/composite/range and most JSON/BSON array element
contracts remain unsupported or untested; grid edits are verified only for
boolean[], bytea[], uuid[], timestamptz[], integer[], text[], numeric[] and float8[], and the full grid/MCP/import
acceptance matrix remains open. Binding text in these tests uses an explicit
PostgreSQL array cast; this does not establish automatic array parameter typing.

Test locations: `crates/drivers/postgres/src/array.rs` and
`crates/drivers/postgres/tests/support/array_contract.rs`, invoked by the ignored
`value_contract_arrays_preserve_elements_dimensions_and_exports` integration test.
The shared value runner selects this test automatically.

The 2026-09-28 P1 reconciliation added a Docker-backed acceptance test in
`crates/drivers/postgres/tests/support/array_contract.rs`,
`array_contract::value_contract_array_grid_edit_preserves_array_elements`, for an
`integer[]` grid edit containing NULL. With Docker access, it reproduced SQLSTATE
42804: the generated UPDATE assigned a TEXT parameter to an `integer[]` column.
The shared keyed-update builder now casts text through `text` to a fixed,
allowlisted PostgreSQL built-in array type. Database metadata is never interpolated
into SQL. PostgreSQL verified the edited value with a typed array comparison;
NULL remained an array NULL element.

The same retained integration case now also checks a `boolean[]` edit. The app
parser preserves `{true,false,NULL}` as text, the update builder casts through
`text` to `pg_catalog.bool[]`, and PostgreSQL's native array text and
`array_send` bytes match after the edit. A second row's original wire bytes
remain unchanged. This expands the server-backed edit matrix to boolean[] as
well as integer[], text[], numeric[] and float8[]. The full PostgreSQL integration
suite passed 64 tests in 119.45 seconds. The strict GTK + DuckDB value runner
later passed 154 selected tests across all 11 suites with no missing suites.
Its current report is `target/quality/20260930T174541378362Z-values/report.json`
(`dirty: true`, based on `9cc0bbb`); the six PostgreSQL array parser tests are
included in the 21 app tests selected by the strict runner.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_postgres_boolean_array_grid_literal_stays_text_through_the_keyed_update_builder -- --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration array_contract::value_contract_array_grid_edit_preserves_array_elements -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The same server-backed array-edit contract also round-trips a `bytea[]` value
with two escaped byte elements, an empty byte string and NULL. The app parser
preserves the array literal as exact text, the builder emits the fixed
`pg_catalog.bytea[]` cast, and the edited row matches PostgreSQL's independent
`array_send` bytes; a sibling row's wire bytes remain unchanged. The focused
app-parser and Docker integration tests passed. The strict shared-value report
above includes this bytea[] contract.

The UUID[] edit exposed a parser bug: `classify_type` matched the `uuid`
substring before accounting for PostgreSQL array metadata, so it tried to parse
the entire `{...}` literal as one UUID. PostgreSQL `[]` metadata now stays text
before scalar classification. The app test checks parsing and keyed-update SQL;
the Docker test compares the edited array's native `array_send` bytes with an
independent server array and confirms the sibling row is unchanged. Both focused
tests passed. The strict GTK + DuckDB runner passed 154 selected tests across
all 11 suites with no missing suites:
`target/quality/20260930T174541378362Z-values/report.json`.
An additional app parser matrix checks that UUID, date, time, numeric, boolean,
and timestamptz array metadata preserve the complete literal as text. The full
app library suite passed 413 tests, with 12 existing ignored tests.
Removing the PostgreSQL array guard made this matrix fail on `uuid[]` with the
scalar UUID parser error; restoring it made the test pass. The targeted
cargo-mutants report generated one whole-function replacement, which was
unviable because `TypeKind` does not implement `Default`; it did not count as a
caught mutant. Report: `target/quality/20260930-pg-array-type-parser-mutants-cached/`.

A PostgreSQL `timestamptz[]` grid edit now carries two offset-origin values with
six fractional digits plus NULL through the app parser and keyed-update cast.
The Docker contract compares the stored value's native `array_send` bytes with

### PostgreSQL array cast allowlist mutation follow-up, 2026-09-30

The hosted core-1 mutation shard exposed missing assertions for the less common
allowlisted array casts. The core regression now enumerates every built-in alias,
checks the exact generated static cast for keyed updates, and rejects unknown
types, SQL-shaped metadata, and malformed precision modifiers. A scoped
`cargo-mutants` run generated 26 mutants for `postgres_array_cast_type`; all 26
were caught, with no missed, timed-out or unviable mutants. This proves the
builder mapping and refusal boundary, not a native-server round trip for every
array type.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core --lib postgres_array_update_casts_allowlist_type_metadata
rtk cargo mutants --dir . --package tablepro-core --file crates/core/src/sql_dialect.rs --re 'postgres_array_cast_type' --test-tool cargo --timeout 30 --build-timeout 120 --output target/quality/20260930-postgres-array-cast-mutants -- --lib postgres_array_update_casts_allowlist_type_metadata
```

The scoped mutation report is at
`target/quality/20260930-postgres-array-cast-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

A focused mutation run on the PostgreSQL array wire decoder generated 13 mutants
for `decode_binary`; all 13 were caught by the library contracts, with no misses,
timeouts or unviable mutants. The hosted quality run at SHA
`8ed0f66ed54b1411feaac5d7a8e49abc6999fb18` did not reach mutation testing for
this crate: its baseline command ran the full Docker value suite and timed out
at 60 seconds while still executing. The CI job now runs decoder mutations
against the unit suite; Docker-backed server oracles remain in Build Linux.
Focused report: `target/quality/20260930-postgres-decode-binary-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

The focused core cast and hostile-metadata tests passed. The Docker-backed
PostgreSQL regression passed after the fix:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core --lib postgres_array_update
cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration array_contract::value_contract_array_grid_edit_preserves_array_elements -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The expanded server test adds a `text[]` edit through the unchanged app text
parser and shared `text` to `pg_catalog.text[]` cast. Its value includes NULL and an
element containing a quote, backslash and comma. An independent `unnest` query
with ordinality checks each element and a separate NULL flag. The app
parser-to-builder unit, focused core cast test, and expanded integration test
passed against PostgreSQL.

Exact grid editing is server-verified for `boolean[]`, `bytea[]`, `uuid[]`, `timestamptz[]`, `integer[]`,
`text[]`, `numeric[]` and `float8[]`. JSON and other
unsupported element OIDs, custom/user-defined arrays
and automatic array parameter typing remain outside the tested support surface.
B3 remains open.

A separate `numeric[]` grid contract now feeds an exact literal containing a
wide numeric with 20 fractional digits, a scale-preserving `1.2300`, NaN,
positive and negative Infinity, and a NULL element through the shared numeric[]
cast. Its independent server oracle unnests with ordinality, checks NULL
separately, and compares every element as `numeric::text`. The app
parser-to-builder unit, PostgreSQL scalar numeric decoder unit, escaped-text
array unit, and Docker-backed numeric[] grid assertion passed against PostgreSQL.

The `jsonb[]` refusal contract checks a native JSONB array containing an object
and JSON null. PostgreSQL independently reports the `jsonb[]` type, its exact
`array_to_json(... )::text`, and semantic JSONB equality. BookiE returns an
`Undecodable` marker and refuses both SQL literal rendering and parameter
binding. This records a precise unsupported boundary; it does not add JSON-array
support.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration array_contract::value_contract_json_array_elements_are_explicitly_unsupported -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

The neighboring `json[]` contract uses the same refusal boundary with a native
JSON array containing an object and JSON `null`. The server reports `json[]`,
returns exact `array_to_json` text, and independently confirms semantic
equality after conversion to `jsonb`. The driver returns `Undecodable`; SQL
literal rendering and parameter binding refuse it. JSON and JSONB array support
is not claimed.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration array_contract::value_contract_json_text_array_is_explicitly_unsupported -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

### PostgreSQL float8[] grid edit at floating-point boundaries, 2026-09-30

The app parser keeps a float8[] grid literal as exact text, and the keyed-update
builder casts it through `text` to the fixed `pg_catalog.float8[]` type. A
PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract edits values containing the adjacent float above
1.0, negative zero, the minimum positive subnormal, NaN, both infinities and
NULL. It compares the stored array text and `array_send` bytes with an
independently constructed native array oracle, verifies the update affects one
row, and confirms a sibling row is unchanged. The focused parser, grid-edit and
full PostgreSQL integration tests passed; the latest full run passed 64 tests
in 119.12 seconds.

The consumer follow-up exercised CSV export, CSV parsing, typed row conversion,
and keyed write-back for the same float8[] result. It found that the generic
CSV importer classified `float8[]` by its element type and rejected the array
cell as `NotANumber`. Array-shaped catalog types now remain exact text during
CSV import. The live round-trip compares the restored row's `array_send` bytes
to the original and checks a third row remains unchanged. SQLx formats numeric
array elements with quotes while PostgreSQL `float8[]::text` does not; the
contract therefore checks exported/imported driver text exactly and uses
native wire bytes, rather than display-string equality, as the stored-value
oracle. The scoped mutation test caught the sole mutation of the changed array
classification condition (1/1). A wider classifier mutation pass initially
exposed missing coverage for the `BLOB` and `BINARY` byte-type aliases; the
catalog contract now pins those spellings, plus `VARBINARY` and `IMAGE`. The
final classifier run caught 13 of 14 mutants, with one unviable replacement and
no survivors or timeouts. After the array fix, the strict GTK + DuckDB value
runner passed 154 tests across all 11 suites with no missing suites; its latest
report is `target/quality/20260930T174541378362Z-values/report.json` (run against
dirty working-tree changes based on `9cc0bbb`).

```

### PostgreSQL float8[] typed CSV INSERT, 2026-10-01

A failing-first extension tested the actual typed INSERT plan after CSV parsing,
not only parser-to-keyed-update behavior. PostgreSQL rejected the array cell
with SQLSTATE `42804` because the import bound it as TEXT. Import plans now use
the same fixed `pg_catalog` allowlist cast as keyed updates for textual array
parameters. The live PostgreSQL 16 test imports a special-value `float8[]` into
a separate table and checks exact `array_send` bytes against the source oracle.
The encompassing contract also retains original and sibling row identities
through the keyed edit.
The focused Docker regression passed.

Mutation testing caught 33 viable SQL-dialect mutations (2 unviable) and 22
viable import-plan mutations (1 unviable), with no survivors or timeouts. The
strict GTK+DuckDB values layer passed 174 selected tests across all 11 suites,
with no missing suites:
[`20261001T024828271108Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T024828271108Z-values/report.json).

```

### PostgreSQL IPv6 `inet[]` explicit refusal

A PostgreSQL 16 contract returns an IPv6 `inet[]` containing a host-prefix
address, a network-prefix address, and NULL. The driver reports the array as
`Undecodable("INET[]")`; PostgreSQL independently reports its native type,
exact array text, JSON representation, element host/prefix/family values, and
equal `array_send` bytes after server-side text re-import. SQL-literal and
parameter consumers refuse the undecodable marker, while a NULL array remains
`Value::Null`. This records the current safe boundary without claiming network
array support.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_ipv6_inet_array_is_explicitly_unsupported -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused PostgreSQL 16 Docker contract passed.

## ClickHouse wide integer parser contract, 2026-09-28

ClickHouse `Int128` and `UInt128` values cannot fit `Value::Int`. A local
regression feeds the unquoted JSON integer tokens for signed minimum, signed
maximum and unsigned maximum through the same `parse_line` and `response_row`
functions used by the driver. All three remain exact `Value::Text`. This verifies
the parser boundary with `serde_json`'s `arbitrary_precision` feature enabled.
The real-server query contract below separately checks native result decoding.

The focused unit command passed, and the mapped change-contract gate passed all
four ClickHouse response regressions. Its report is
`target/quality/20260928T113903658583Z-change-contracts/report.json`.

```sh
cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --lib clickhouse_json_row_preserves_wide_integer_tokens_exactly
```

Protocol references: [PostgreSQL arrays](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/arrays.html)
and [array_send](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_16_STABLE/src/backend/utils/adt/arrayfuncs.c).

### ClickHouse wide integer result, binding and SQL re-import, 2026-09-28

The signed Int128 minimum and maximum and unsigned UInt128 maximum pass through
text-valued bound parameters into native Int128/UInt128 columns and return as
exact `Value::Text`. The result row is written with the shared generated INSERT
literal, executed into matching native columns, and read back as the exact
original text. The same real-server result passes through CSV export, the shared
CSV reader and typed import cell parser both with formula sanitization disabled
and with default formula sanitization. The default-mode import is bound into a
second native Int128/UInt128 table and read back from ClickHouse to verify the
stored digits. Default export prefixes the negative
Int128 with an apostrophe; import removes that marker only when the column type
is exactly Int128 or UInt128 and the remaining signed digits fit that type.
Ordinary text, invalid values, unsigned negatives and overflow retain the
apostrophe. This preserves formula protection for other text columns while the
three wide integer fields re-import as their exact original text. The first
import attempt exposed two issues: `Int128` was classified as i64, then the
formula-safe apostrophe remained in text-backed wide integers. Both import paths
are now covered.

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration wide_integer_binding_and_sql_export_preserve_exact_server_values -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The CSV round trip covers this wide-integer result path with formula
sanitization both disabled and enabled. The grid contract also covers the four
adjacent wide-integer boundaries:
Int128 minimum to minimum+1, Int128 maximum to maximum-1, UInt128 zero to one,
and UInt128 maximum to maximum-1. Other export formats remain open.

### ClickHouse nested value consumer boundary, 2026-09-30

The live contract covers seven nested Array/Map/Tuple shapes: the three base
forms plus Array(Map), Map(Array), Tuple(Array), and Map(Tuple). Each value is
compared with ClickHouse's native `toTypeName` and `toJSONString` oracles, including
wide unsigned values that JSON must quote. A plain `Value::Json` no longer
carries the native type needed to distinguish numeric strings from text
strings, so SQL-literal export and parameter binding explicitly refuse all
seven nested shapes instead of writing a changed value. Each shape also goes
through the keyed grid-update builder against a real MergeTree row: the driver
returns `Transaction { statement_index: 0, source: Unsupported }`, and the
stored id, value, native type and server JSON remain unchanged. The original
array case retains its direct cell-literal refusal contract too.

The focused Docker integration case and the complete ClickHouse Docker suite
passed (33 tests). The expanded focused case verifies refusal for all seven
grid edits; its ignored test is listed in `docs/ignored-tests.md`.

The two exporter refusal tests also passed scoped mutation checks: the shared
renderer caught all three selected mutations, including making the ClickHouse
guard unconditional; the ClickHouse grid renderer caught both selected
function-replacement mutations. Reports are in
`target/quality/20260929-clickhouse-json-mutants-core-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`
and
`target/quality/20260929-clickhouse-grid-json-mutants-lib-only-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The new seven-shape real-grid refusal contract also caught both selected
whole-function renderer mutations, with no missed, timed-out or unviable cases:
`target/quality/20260930-clickhouse-nested-grid-refusal-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration nested_values::value_contract_nested_collections_keep_exact_json_and_refuse_lossy_consumers -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

### ClickHouse Int128 and UInt128 grid edits, 2026-09-28

A real-server keyed update changes both rows through the same shared builder
used by the grid save path. It moves Int128 minimum to minimum+1 and UInt128
maximum to maximum-1, then Int128 maximum to maximum-1 and UInt128 zero to one.
The independent result query compares all four exact text values and verifies
the non-target row remains unchanged after each edit.

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration wide_integer_grid_edits_preserve_exact_values_and_row_identity -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

Validation on the working tree based on `7cb2fe3ca`: all 50 PostgreSQL
unit/integration tests passed. The full local gate passed at
`target/quality/20260926T204949649377Z-full/report.json`; Debian package validation
was skipped because `dpkg-deb` is unavailable. The subsequent shared run caught
an overly literal metadata expectation: SQLx names PostgreSQL bpchar arrays
`CHAR[]`. After correcting that assertion, all 11 suites passed at
`target/quality/20260926T205412392759Z-values/report.json`, including all eight
drivers, GTK and DuckDB. That run reused 744 artifacts, rebuilt one package and
spent 3.034 seconds compiling. Function/file size guards and whitespace checks
also passed. Installed desktop acceptance remains a later gate.

## PostgreSQL time checkpoint

B3-2 adopts the temporal-boundary scenarios from the
[external survey](b3-test-scenario-survey.md). The new server regression first
failed because `24:00:00` was decoded as midnight: exported wire bytes changed
from `000000141dd76000` to `0000000000000000`.

Binary time decoding now retains ordinary times as typed values, preserves
`24:00:00` as exact text, and represents timetz as text with its stored signed
offset, including seconds. Column metadata retains TIME/TIMETZ. NULL remains
NULL. Invalid wire lengths, out-of-range times and offsets are refused.

Eleven cases run under UTC, Asia/Kathmandu and America/New_York, covering
microseconds, end-of-day and both offset extremes. Tests compare time_send or
timetz_send bytes after SQL literal re-import, explicitly typed bindings and
generated INSERT exports. Direct/session parity, type metadata and JSON text
fidelity are asserted. The permanent test is
`value_contract_times_preserve_midnight_fraction_and_offset`; malformed-wire and
boundary units live in `crates/drivers/postgres/src/temporal.rs`.

This checkpoint does not establish editing support for text-backed time values,
temporal arrays, BC/large-year dates, infinities, mixed intervals or every
grid/MCP/XLSX consumer. Those B3 cases remain open. Protocol references:
[date/time types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/datatype-datetime.html) and
[time/timetz send and receive](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_16_STABLE/src/backend/utils/adt/date.c).

Fresh cargo-mutants 27.1.0 evidence, on the working tree based on `6de5351ee`:

| Scope | Result | Report beneath target/quality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Array decode entry, scalar elements and float rendering, 26 generated mutations | 24 caught, 1 survivor, 1 unviable | `20260926-b3-array-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json` |
| Array survivor after including malformed-input unit tests | 1 caught, no survivors/timeouts | `20260926-b3-array-mutants-followup/mutants.out/outcomes.json` |
| Complete new time decoder, 22 generated mutations | 21 caught, 1 unviable, no survivors/timeouts | `20260926-b3-time-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json` |

The array survivor removed the NUL-byte guard. Its existing unit regression was
omitted by the mutation run's `value_contract` filter; array/numeric malformed
units now share that prefix. The rerun caught the mutation. Both unviable changes
attempted to construct a nonexistent default Value and failed compilation; they
are not test catches. These were scratch-source runs reusing the local target
directory, with no concurrent Cargo build. The time mutation run used unit tests;
array runs also used the real-server value contracts. This is scoped evidence,
not a complete array, numeric, workspace or hosted mutation pass.

Local validation: `target/quality/20260926T210713778702Z-full/report.json`
passed formatting, Clippy, unit and sandbox checks. Debian package validation
was skipped because `dpkg-deb` is unavailable. The stricter shared runner passed
all 11 selected suites at
`target/quality/20260926T210925595822Z-values/report.json`, including four
PostgreSQL server contracts and all eight drivers with GTK/DuckDB selected.
The complete PostgreSQL unit/integration run also passed all 53 tests.
Ten runner/workflow regression tests passed, including a later refinement that
rejects a mutation report containing only unviable changes. Workflow YAML parsed;
the mutation summary shell was executed against complete, missing, empty and
unviable-only fixture reports. Function/file size and whitespace guards passed.
Hosted mutation/coverage execution and installed desktop acceptance remain
separate from these local results.

## PostgreSQL era and mutation checkpoint

The BC regression reproduced an export failure: `0001-01-01 BC` became the
invalid PostgreSQL literal `0000-01-01`. PostgreSQL SQL rendering now uses era
years and a BC suffix, and removes the ISO leading plus for years above 9999.
Other dialects and ordinary AD formatting retain their existing contracts.
Fifteen server cases run in three session time zones, covering BC dates,
large representable years, microseconds, the PostgreSQL epoch boundary and both
instants of a repeated DST hour. Direct/session values, type metadata, typed
bindings, SQL literals and generated INSERTs are compared with server wire bytes.
The integration test is `value_contract_dates_preserve_eras_large_years_and_instants`;
its lowest-tier regression is in core's SQL literal tests. Dates outside chrono's
range now have native text/wire oracles, visible JSON/CSV refusal markers, and
explicit SQL-literal/parameter refusal. They still lack exact application value
support. Infinities, mixed intervals, temporal arrays and non-SQL consumer/editing
acceptance remain open.

At this checkpoint, the extended-calendar contract parsed DATE and TIMESTAMP
exports back through the CSV reader and checked visible `<undecodable DATE>` and
`<undecodable TIMESTAMP>` markers; JSON output was checked as structured JSON.
The October 3 continuation below supersedes that refusal status for the named
DATE, TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMPTZ ranges with exact-value consumer support.

The PostgreSQL temporal infinity test then exposed a default CSV formula marker
that typed import rejected for `-infinity`. Import now removes the marker only
for recognized PostgreSQL temporal sentinels. Import plans cast consistent text
parameters to the destination temporal type, and integration coverage confirms
native re-import of positive/negative infinities, `TIME '24:00:00'`, and
`TIMETZ` with offset seconds. The complete PostgreSQL integration target passed
64 tests. Core import/planner and SQL-dialect suites passed 81 and 45 tests:

Scoped mutation testing caught all 19 viable changes in the PostgreSQL
temporal CSV classifier (5 unviable), all 21 viable import-plan mutations (1
unviable), and all 15 viable SQL insert-cast mutations (2 unviable), with no
survivors or timeouts. Reports:
[`import classifier`](../target/quality/20261001-postgres-temporal-import-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json),

```

The strict GTK+DuckDB values layer then passed 169 selected tests across all 11
suites, with no missing suites:

```

The [CI audit](ci-audit-2026-09-27.md) found nine survivors in the broader hosted
PostgreSQL mutation run. New regressions use an independent 16,777,216-byte limit,
test exact quoted-output and raw-element boundaries, check dimension rejection
before decoding, reject fractional groups beyond declared scale and preserve
one-digit fractions and noncanonical numeric text. Bounded element reading is
now a directly testable helper; the size policy is unchanged. No mutation was
blanket-excluded.

Local cargo-mutants 27.1.0 evidence, working tree based on `c57ac7715`:

| Scope | Result | Report beneath target/quality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Changed SQL date renderer | 10 caught, 1 unviable, no survivors/timeouts | `20260926-b3-date-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json` |
| Array/numeric functions implicated by hosted survivors | 58 caught, 1 additional unit-only survivor, 3 unviable | `20260927-b3-pg-survivors/mutants.out/outcomes.json` |
| Numeric type survivor after independent-oracle correction | 1 caught, no survivors/timeouts | `20260927-b3-numeric-type-followup/mutants.out/outcomes.json` |

The additional survivor changed normal numerics from Decimal to Text. The unit
test reused decode_text as its own expected-value oracle; it now asserts the
independent value, variant and decimal text. The server contract already covered
this type distinction. Unviable mutations are compilation failures, not catches.
Diff-scoped mutation listing required workspace-relative paths and explicit
`--src-prefix=a/ --dst-prefix=b/` because the local Git mnemonic prefixes produced
an empty selection. The list was checked before executing the 11 date mutations.

Final local validation for this checkpoint: formatting, Clippy, unit and sandbox
checks passed at `target/quality/20260926T231119112831Z-full/report.json`.
All 11 selected value-contract suites passed at
`target/quality/20260926T231558864082Z-values/report.json`, including all eight
drivers, GTK, DuckDB, nine core contracts and five PostgreSQL server contracts.
Compilation reused 707 artifacts and rebuilt 17 affected packages in 39.688s.
All eight SSH fixture tests and 15 runner/workflow regression tests passed.
The complete PostgreSQL unit/integration suite passed all 55 tests with ignored
fixture tests explicitly enabled (`--include-ignored --test-threads=1`).
Hosted execution, the broader core mutation backlog and installed desktop
acceptance remain separate gates.

## XLSX temporal consumer checkpoint, 2026-09-27

Workbook XML regressions reproduced that temporal values were forced into
spreadsheet serial cells: fractional seconds were displayed with whole-second
formats, timezone-bearing timestamps lost their explicit UTC identity, and
dates outside the native spreadsheet range lacked a text fallback. Exports now
write fractional Time/DateTime values, every TimestampTz and dates/timestamps
outside 1900–9999 as exact text using the existing canonical export spelling.
Supported dates and whole-second values retain native cells. Text timestamps
include their UTC offset; the two distinct instants in a repeated DST hour stay
distinct. This intentionally trades spreadsheet date arithmetic for exact text
when the native cell cannot carry the contract.

A timestamp originating at `+05:30` with nine fractional digits is also checked
in the XLSX shared string. The emitted canonical UTC text is
`2026-09-27T07:04:56.123456789+00:00`, preserving the exact instant across the
offset conversion; the corresponding CSV typed-import contract independently
checks the same instant.

Three added unit contracts inspect ZIP worksheet/shared-string XML: temporal
fallbacks, native boundary dates/whole-second cells, and finite/nonfinite floats
versus NULL. The temporal test failed before the fix. Eight XLSX unit tests pass.
This does not establish every IEEE floating-point rounding behavior, arbitrary
precision editing, temporal arrays or all remaining consumer/driver types.

Cargo-mutants selected 15 mutations in the complete XLSX cell writer. All 15 were
caught, with no missed, timeout or unviable outcomes. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260927-b3-xlsx-temporal-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
This includes both finite-float guard survivors from hosted run `36280114335`;
row/column error-path and other export survivors remain separate triage work.

The shared eight-driver runner passed all 11 suites, including 12 core value
contracts, at `target/quality/20260927T091952740079Z-values/report.json`.
All 19 installed release-build UI scenarios passed and wrote successful result
JSON files under `target/quality/20260927-b3-xlsx-ui/`. The layer report
`target/quality/20260927T091941354836Z-layers/report.json` intentionally remains
failed: its initial full gate caught two unnecessary clones in the new tests,
while the independent value/UI layers passed. The clones were corrected rather
than suppressing Clippy. Thirty Python harness tests passed, including both
successful and failed GTK artifact-production regressions.
The corrected full gate passed at
`target/quality/20260927T092738833389Z-layers/report.json` (formatting, Clippy,
workspace unit/binary tests and sandbox regressions). Hosted execution and
installed Wayland/package acceptance remain separate from these local checks.

## Workbook UI and failure-boundary checkpoint, 2026-09-27

Three default installed-GTK scenarios exercise keyboard format selection and the
real save chooser: exact typed SQLite export, save cancellation, and visible
empty-text refusal. The XML oracle checks wide signed integers, nanosecond
precision, dates outside 1900–9999, native numeric dates/times, NULL, infinity,
formula-like Unicode text and the 100-row page boundary. Every scenario compares
all source rows before and after. Four Python tests cover oracle failures,
formula rejection and default scenario registration.

The expanded UI corpus found a new defect: rust_xlsxwriter discards empty strings,
so successful workbook export silently collapsed empty text into missing cells.
The initial combined report `target/quality/20260927T094125010168Z-layers/report.json`
therefore remains failed, with full/value layers passed and the UI assertion
failing on the missing cell. A core regression also failed before correction.
Workbook export now refuses empty text with its one-based data row/column and
CSV/JSON alternatives. The dedicated UI scenario requires that visible error,
no published file and no temporary export. A public core regression separately
requires existing destination bytes to survive this refusal. This is an explicit
format limitation, not a claim that XLSX now round-trips empty text.

Coordinate regressions also reproduced accepting column 16,385 in the converter.
The writer now checks the actual worksheet limits before narrowing coordinates,
reserves the header row, and saturates diagnostic counts instead of overflowing.
Public file tests cover column-limit refusal and cancellation after a row has
been written; both leave existing destination bytes intact and no temporary file.

Final local evidence for this checkpoint:

- `target/quality/20260927T095051662483Z-layers/report.json`: full, values, UI and
  harness layers all passed; 34 Python harness tests passed.
- `target/quality/20260927T095333331615Z-values/report.json`: all 11 suites passed,
  including eight drivers, GTK, DuckDB and 16 core value contracts.
- `target/quality/20260927-b3-workbook-ui-corrected/`: all 22 installed release
  scenarios passed, with 22 result JSON files and 22 stderr artifacts.
- `target/quality/20260927-b3-xlsx-refusal-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`:
  all 11 selected `write_row`/`cell_column` mutations caught; no missed, timeout or
  unviable outcomes. This final run includes the empty-text refusal and supersedes
  the earlier seven-coordinate-mutation run for this checkpoint.

These are local X11/AT-SPI and fixture results. Hosted CI, network-database temporal
UI scenarios, installed Wayland/package acceptance and the remaining B3 type and
consumer contracts remain separate work.

## Mixed bindings and failure propagation checkpoint, 2026-09-27

The shared SQL contract now passes named parameters through extraction, typed
input parsing, placeholder generation, driver binding and server decoding in one
query. Each of PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, ClickHouse, SQLite and DuckDB checks
three adversarial payloads across repeated names and mixed types. Expected rows
are constructed independently of the binding list. Quoted/commented colon names
must not become parameters. Redis and MongoDB continue their protocol-specific
contracts rather than receiving synthetic SQL scenarios.

Two installed GTK scenarios check committed rows: repeated parameters preserve
signed integer limits and SQL-like Unicode data; cancellation writes nothing and
a retry uses replacement values. Lexer regressions cover nested PostgreSQL
comments/dollar quotes, MySQL escaped quotes and SQL Server escaped identifiers.
Explicit text parsing retains whitespace and numeric/placeholder-looking text.

Transport regressions cover all explicit TLS modes against both legacy TLS flags,
CA paths, connection identity, authentication and timeout propagation. Local
sockets refuse every enabled TLS mode plus missing/regular-file paths before any
driver dial. These are deterministic option/refusal tests, not new live TLS or
SSH acceptance evidence.

Export writer tests simulate three-byte writes, interrupted writes and destination
I/O failures. All six text formats must finish short writes without byte loss;
all seven formats, including XLSX, must propagate write failures. These injected
writer failures do not simulate filesystem exhaustion or a broken network stream.

The first parser mutation run intentionally remains failed at
`target/quality/20260927-b3-parameter-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`:
16 caught, one survivor, five timeouts and two unviable mutations. The survivor
removed the Boolean false arm; a new truth-table regression covers accepted
true/false spellings and invalid text. Extractor tests now call the parser on a
worker with a two-second receive deadline, turning nontermination into a test
failure rather than waiting for cargo-mutants to kill the suite. Production
parsing is unchanged. Compilation failures are unviable, not caught mutations.

The installed UI run reused the release binary from checkpoint `39198f1` because
this change only adds tests and documentation. Its SHA-256 is
`010fbec4d00d9cd391fa982e54ab038ac18a16d43755369c6afc28b31555cd30`.

The corrected run at
`target/quality/20260927-b3-parameter-mutants-corrected/mutants.out/outcomes.json`
caught all 22 compilable mutations, with two unviable, no survivors and no timeouts.
No mutation was excluded. The initial combined full/value/UI/harness run passed at
`target/quality/20260927T100452073699Z-layers/report.json`; its eight-driver report
is `target/quality/20260927T100713477391Z-values/report.json`. All 24 installed UI
scenarios passed with 24 JSON/stderr pairs in
`target/quality/20260927-b3-parameter-ui/`. Thirty-five Python harness tests passed.

After the Boolean and bounded-parser refinements, the final full/value/harness
rerun passed at `target/quality/20260927T101253832016Z-layers/report.json`.
All 11 value suites passed again at
`target/quality/20260927T101514358887Z-values/report.json`, including 21 core
contracts. Hosted CI and B4–B6 acceptance remain separate; B3 stays open for the
remaining native types and consumer parity.

## XML text consumer checkpoint, 2026-09-27

Two core regressions failed before the fix: literal carriage returns were not
protected from parser normalization, and XML-illegal text was silently replaced
with U+FFFD while export reported success. An installed-app reproducer against
the previous binary also failed after parsing its real exported file; evidence
is retained under `target/quality/20260927-b3-xml-before/`.

XML export now writes CR as `&#13;`, preserving standalone CR and CRLF alongside
LF, tabs, literal entity-looking text and Unicode. Unsupported XML 1.0 characters
are refused with the code point and one-based data row/column, with a JSON export
suggestion. Existing destination bytes survive the refusal, including when an
earlier row has already been written to the temporary file. Tests cover NUL,
controls, U+FFFE/U+FFFF, legal Unicode range boundaries, NULL and empty text.
The behavior follows [XML line-ending handling](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-line-ends)
and [legal XML characters](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets).

Two default installed-GTK scenarios exercise XML selection and the save chooser,
then parse the output or require the visible refusal. Four Python tests validate
the independent oracle and scenario registration, including deliberately
normalized line endings and an empty-text/NULL corruption. The existing workbook
scenarios share the named export-format keyboard helper. XML column-name
sanitization and type annotation are unchanged; this text checkpoint does not
establish reversible arbitrary column labels or complete typed XML import.

Scoped mutation evidence is
`target/quality/20260927-b3-xml-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`: 15 caught,
one unviable, no survivors or timeouts across the row writer, text escaping and
legal-character predicate. The compilation failure is not counted as a catch.
The shared value report at `target/quality/20260927T102839954853Z-values/report.json`
passed all 11 suites, including 24 core contracts and all eight drivers.

Final local full/value/UI/harness report:
`target/quality/20260927T102554255832Z-layers/report.json`, all layers passed.
All 26 installed release-build UI scenarios passed with 26 JSON/stderr pairs at
`target/quality/20260927-b3-xml-ui/`; all 39 Python harness tests passed.
These are X11/AT-SPI and local fixture results. Hosted CI, installed Wayland and
package acceptance remain separate; B3 stays open for remaining native types
and consumer parity before B4–B6 acceptance.

## DuckDB native temporal and enum checkpoint

The native decoder previously exposed `date32:-1`, timestamp unit counters, interval descriptions and Arrow collection debug output as ordinary text. The first new live embedded-engine regression failed when SQL re-import tried to parse `date32:-1` as a date.

Dates and times now use shared typed values where representable. Timestamp seconds, milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds are split with Euclidean division so negative fractional epochs retain their exact fraction. Arrow timezone metadata selects the UTC instant variant. Enum dictionary labels preserve empty text, literal NULL text, Unicode and SQL NULL. Date infinities, BC dates and years above 9999 use DuckDB-compatible text; 24:00:00 remains distinct from midnight.

The enum contract also round-trips the empty, `NULL`, and Unicode labels through
SQL literals and typed parameters. Each server result retains an ENUM native
type and exact VARCHAR label; the literal label `NULL` remains distinct from
SQL NULL.

The integration corpus checks server-rendered source values against both parameter rebinding and generated SQL literals, plus independent JSON expectations for nanosecond timestamps and microsecond times. It includes nulls for every temporal family. Decoder unit tests cover all four units, negative remainders, end-of-day boundaries and arithmetic overflow.

Mixed month/day/microsecond intervals now preserve DuckDB's native month, day and nanosecond carrier fields as exact text with an explicit microsecond unit. A live embedded-engine contract checks `typeof`, DuckDB's `VARCHAR` representation and independent `date_part` component oracles, then re-imports through both a generated SQL literal and an explicitly cast bound parameter. DuckDB column metadata now exposes simple and composite primary keys from `duckdb_constraints()`, with an independent catalog oracle. A separate app-parser contract sends edited text through the keyed-update builder and verifies the saved native INTERVAL type and signed month/day/microsecond components. Intervals with sub-microsecond carrier precision remain explicitly undecodable. A MAP containing a UHUGEINT above `u64::MAX` and explicit NULL has exact native `typeof` and `VARCHAR` oracles; LIST, fixed ARRAY, STRUCT and UNION have exact native type and JSON rendering oracles. The driver, SQL-literal and parameter consumers explicitly refuse all these collection kinds. The `UHUGEINT[]` case has a native `typeof` and exact `VARCHAR` oracle for `18446744073709551616`; it is explicitly undecodable, and SQL literal and parameter consumers refuse it. Other interval boundaries, installed GTK acceptance and additional nested collection combinations remain open. At this checkpoint, dates outside the shared calendar range and finite timestamps outside years 1–9999 were explicitly undecodable; the October 3 follow-up below now covers named extended DATE/TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ values. This is not full native-type, arbitrary-precision editing, MCP or release acceptance.

The interval boundary contract now covers `i32::MIN`/`i32::MAX` months and days,
plus the largest positive and negative whole-microsecond values that fit the
driver's signed nanosecond carrier. Independent `typeof`, `VARCHAR`, and
`date_part` assertions account for DuckDB normalizing months into years and
microseconds into clock fields. Both extremes round-trip through generated SQL
and explicitly cast bound parameters. Other mixed-sign combinations and the
installed GTK edit path remain open.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_interval_component_extremes_round_trip_as_exact_text -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused embedded-engine contract passed.

The DuckDB decoder mutation pass initially found a surviving `UBigInt` signed-boundary comparison. Unit assertions now pin `i64::MAX` to `Value::Int` and `i64::MAX + 1` to exact decimal text. The final scoped run caught 11/12 mutants, with one unviable whole-function replacement and no survivors or timeouts: `target/quality/20260929-duckdb-interval-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_interval_components_round_trip_as_exact_text -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

The local embedded-engine contract passed.

Sub-microsecond TIME and TIMESTAMP values, plus every `TimestampTz`, are sent
through DuckDB parameters as exact VARCHAR values because the bundled client has
no lossless native bind type for these cases. An unignored integration contract
checks `typeof(?)` and exact echoed text for a nanosecond TIME, a pre-epoch
nanosecond TIMESTAMP, and a nine-digit offset-origin TIMESTAMPTZ. It confirms
transport preservation and the UTC instant, not native typed binding; callers
must cast explicitly when using these text parameters in typed expressions.

A companion direct-binding contract uses the pinned `duckdb` crate's own
`Value::Time64(Nanosecond, ...)` and `Value::Timestamp(Nanosecond, ...)`
parameters. DuckDB reports native TIME/TIMESTAMP types but returns only the
first six fractional digits (`12:34:56.123456` and
`2026-09-27 12:34:56.123456`), proving the crate's nanoseconds-to-microseconds
conversion is lossy. This is why the adapter retains exact VARCHAR fallback.
The focused regression passed:

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration pinned_duckdb_binding_api_truncates_nanosecond_temporals_to_microseconds -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_submicro_temporals_bind_as_exact_text -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused test and the full DuckDB integration suite passed (16 tests).

### DuckDB TIMESTAMPTZ grid-edit precision boundary

A failing-first app parser contract showed that a nine-digit
`TimestampTz` edit was accepted for DuckDB `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`. The
independent embedded-engine oracle binds the exact value as text and casts it
to native TIMESTAMPTZ; `epoch_us` proves the server drops the non-microsecond
digits. The app now refuses values whose nanoseconds are not divisible by
1,000 before the keyed update is built. It still accepts ordinary microsecond
precision and nine-digit spellings with three trailing zeroes. An app-level
DuckDB grid contract uses actual column metadata, verifies refusal leaves the
stored epoch unchanged, then saves an offset-origin, microsecond-aligned edit
and checks the resulting native type and exact UTC epoch.

The same precision check was missing for DuckDB `TIME` and `TIMESTAMP` grid
edits. A new failing-first app parser regression reproduced acceptance of
nine-digit fractions for these microsecond columns. The keyed-edit test also
checks native `TIMESTAMP_S` and `TIMESTAMP_MS` casts, proving those discard
unsupported fractional digits at their declared precision. It then verifies the
parser refuses all four edits and leaves existing native values unchanged.
Precision-aware parsing still accepts exact microsecond and millisecond values;
nanosecond `TIMESTAMP_NS` values remain exact, while `TIME_NS` stays as text.

The strict GTK + DuckDB runner passed all 156 selected tests across 11 suites
with no missing suites at dirty revision `fde1128`:
`target/quality/20260930T182412713329Z-values/report.json`. The DuckDB app
parser/grid cases live in `crates/app/tests/support/duckdb_temporal_edit_contract.rs`
to keep the shared parser contract below the hosted 1,200-line file-size limit.
A scoped
`cargo-mutants` pass generated 13 changes to `parse_duckdb_temporal_input`; the
app library tests caught 12, with 0 missed, 0 timeouts and 1 unviable in
`target/quality/20260930-duckdb-temporal-grid-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

The scoped mutation report caught 9 of 10 generated changes to this precision
guard; one whole-function replacement was unviable, with no survivors or
timeouts:
`target/quality/20260929-duckdb-timestamptz-guard-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

The earlier app-parser mutation run had four apparent survivors because its test
filter selected only the DuckDB case while `parse_input_for_driver` also routes
PostgreSQL numeric input. A corrected full app-library mutation run caught all
four viable changes; the fifth was an unviable whole-function replacement:
`target/quality/20260930-app-value-parser-cross-driver-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_duckdb_timestamptz_parser_refuses_submicro_edits
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-app --features duckdb --lib value_contract_duckdb_timestamptz_grid_edit_refuses_submicro_rounding
rtk cargo mutants --manifest-path crates/app/Cargo.toml --in-place --file crates/app/src/ui/browse_tab/value_parse.rs --re parse_input_for_driver --output target/quality/20260930-app-value-parser-cross-driver-mutants --no-config -- --lib
rtk proxy ./scripts/test-value-contracts.sh --gtk --duckdb
```

The strict combined run passed all 127 tests across 11 suites with no missing
suites and a clean checkout at `cdbb15b538656602a9fdd08f4e6626deb2553540`.
The report is `target/quality/20260929T194746719695Z-values/report.json`.

### DuckDB scalar HUGEINT consumer parity

The embedded DuckDB contract checks signed `HUGEINT` minimum/maximum and
`UHUGEINT` maximum. Native `typeof` and `VARCHAR` projections confirm exact
decimal digits; result decoding, SQL-literal re-import and text-bound casts
preserve the same values. These scalar contracts are separate from the
explicitly undecodable nested `UHUGEINT[]` case.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_scalar_hugeints_preserve_exact_text_across_consumers -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused embedded DuckDB test passed.

Run locally:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --lib --test integration
./scripts/test-value-contracts.sh --gtk --duckdb
```

The strict value runner automatically includes the new integration cases. Native decoder unit cases also run in the optional DuckDB crate test job. Protocol references: [DuckDB timestamps](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/sql/data_types/timestamp) and [interval basis units](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/sql/data_types/interval).

Validation: the DuckDB crate passed 16 tests (12 unit, four integration). Full local checks, all 11 selected value suites and the Python harness passed in `target/quality/20260927T104559674200Z-layers/report.json`; detailed value evidence is `target/quality/20260927T104731515648Z-values/report.json`. The combined value build reused 742 artifacts and rebuilt only the DuckDB package. Installed UI/Wayland and package acceptance were not rerun for this driver-only checkpoint.

Optional-driver Clippy (`cargo clippy --locked -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --all-targets -- -D warnings`) also passed. Its first run selected a separate native build fingerprint and rebuilt the bundled C++ library; this differs from the cached combined value runner above. Reuse a consistent command/feature graph for routine value checks.

Scoped mutation evidence: `target/quality/20260927-b3-duckdb-temporal-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json` records all 31 generated mutations in `temporal.rs`: 28 caught, three unviable, zero survivors and zero timeouts. Both the crate unit tests and integration suite ran for each viable mutation; compile failures are not counted as catches. Command:

```sh
mkdir -p target/mutation-tmp
TMPDIR=$PWD/target/mutation-tmp CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$PWD/target cargo mutants --package tablepro-driver-duckdb --file crates/drivers/duckdb/src/temporal.rs --test-tool cargo --timeout 30 --build-timeout 180 --output target/quality/duckdb-temporal-mutants -- --lib --test integration
```

## PostgreSQL interval fields, temporal arrays and infinities

The native interval regression first failed when `i64::MIN` microseconds became `-2562047788:00:54.775808`, which PostgreSQL could not parse back. Large hour fields now use an exact decimal-seconds representation. Any negative interval component triggers explicit signs on positive components, avoiding IntervalStyle-dependent reinterpretation. The corpus constructs expected months/days/microseconds wire bytes itself and checks the source fixture before comparing decoder results. It covers 59 boundary/generated cases across postgres, sql_standard, postgres_verbose and iso_8601 styles (236 combinations), pooled/session parity, SQL literals, typed casts of bound text and JSON text.

A second reproducer returned Undecodable for DATE infinity and date arrays. The driver now recognizes PostgreSQL infinity sentinels and decodes date, time, timetz, timestamp, timestamptz and interval array elements. Existing array dimension/lower-bound and size guards remain. Native array_send equality checks cover eras, year 10000, microseconds, end-of-day time, second-resolution offsets, DST-distinct instants, infinities, NULL elements and multidimensional bounds. SQL INSERT and bound parameter re-imports are included; a session in Asia/Kathmandu verifies that timestamp array imports preserve UTC instants.

New unit contracts check temporal element lengths, out-of-range payloads, empty/null arrays, infinity signs, era formatting and interval extremes. A real PostgreSQL DATE at year 1,000,000 remains within the server's finite range but exceeds chrono's shared calendar: the driver returns `Undecodable("DATE")`, while an independent `date::text` column remains exactly `1000000-01-01`. The app date parser rejects that input, and SQL literal rendering and parameter binding refuse the undecodable marker. A TIMESTAMP at PostgreSQL's upper finite bound, `294276-12-31 23:59:59.999999`, is also accepted by the server but returned as `Undecodable("TIMESTAMP")`; its independent `timestamp::text` value is exact, and the app parser, SQL literal renderer and parameter binder refuse it. Full finite temporal support beyond chrono's range, unsupported element types and broader consumer parity remain open. These changes do not prove complete native-type support for PostgreSQL or the other drivers.

Run `cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-postgres --lib value_contract`, then `cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-postgres --test integration value_contract_dates_preserve_eras_large_years_and_instants -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1` with Docker available. The combined strict value runner discovers all seven PostgreSQL server contracts. Updated fixture declarations are recorded in [ignored tests](ignored-tests.md).

Reference: [PostgreSQL interval input and storage](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-INTERVAL-INPUT). The strategy for extending these proofs across drivers is in [type contracts](type-contract-strategy.md).

Mutation evidence: `target/quality/20260927-b3-pg-native-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json` records 74 selected mutations: 73 caught, one unviable, zero survivors and zero timeouts. This measurement ran value-contract unit tests for interval decoding/formatting, temporal-array dispatch/text and scalar temporal decoding; it was not a full-workspace mutation run. The separate PostgreSQL 16 fixture run supplies real-server evidence. Reproduce from the Linux workspace:

```sh
mkdir -p target/mutation-tmp
TMPDIR=$PWD/target/mutation-tmp CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$PWD/target cargo mutants --package tablepro-driver-postgres --file crates/drivers/postgres/src/temporal.rs --file crates/drivers/postgres/src/array.rs --file crates/drivers/postgres/src/decode.rs --re 'decode_interval|format_interval|push_counted|decode_temporal|temporal_element|array_text' --test-tool cargo --timeout 30 --build-timeout 180 --output target/quality/pg-native-mutants -- --lib value_contract
```

The first full-gate attempts remain recorded in `20260927T110823517670Z-layers/report.json` (stale ignored-test inventory) and `20260927T110938605682Z-layers/report.json` (file-size guard). Both are under `target/quality/`. The inventory was regenerated and scalar temporal decoding moved into the existing temporal module without raising a guardrail baseline. The subsequent `20260927T111058478564Z-layers/report.json` passed full, values and harness; its value report is `20260927T111306775227Z-values/report.json` with all 11 suites and seven PostgreSQL contracts passing.

Final clean-source validation after mutation testing passed full, values and harness in `target/quality/20260927T111941420743Z-layers/report.json`. All 11 selected value suites passed in `target/quality/20260927T112138445468Z-values/report.json`; compilation reused 745 artifacts, rebuilt zero packages and took 0.592 seconds. Installed UI/Wayland and package acceptance were not rerun for this driver checkpoint.

## MySQL native TIME, zero-date and YEAR checkpoint

The reproducer ran against MySQL 8 with a permissive `sql_mode`. Before the fix, `-01:00:00` read back as `01:00:00`. Zero DATE, DATETIME and TIMESTAMP values read as NULL, because sqlx reports an all-zero binary value as NULL. TIME outside one day, dates with zero parts and every YEAR value were undecodable. Times of day remain `Time`. Negative or extended times, zero dates and dates with zero parts are now exact text, and YEAR is an integer. sqlx 0.9 also reports the TIME sign inverted, so the driver reads the sign field directly.

The test compares every value with an independent expected value. It then writes the rows back through bound parameters and SQL INSERT export, and the server confirms all six rows match with `<=>`. Scoped cargo-mutants on `crates/drivers/mysql/src/temporal.rs`: 16 mutants, 13 caught, 3 unviable, zero survivors and zero timeouts, using the recipe above with `-- --lib --test integration -- --include-ignored calendar_fields native_time_zero`.

MySQL `TIMESTAMP` values are exact only while the server session is UTC because MySQL returns a session-local wall time and sqlx decodes it as UTC. Driver-owned pool connections set `time_zone = '+00:00'` when created and reset it before each checkout. Dedicated sessions start in UTC; if a session later uses another time zone, non-NULL `TIMESTAMP` cells are returned as undecodable rather than as a wrong instant. A Docker regression first reproduced the mismatch at `+05:45`, then verified the independent session-local text and Unix-epoch microseconds while checking the refusal marker. The same regression changes a pooled connection to `+05:45` and confirms the next checkout still returns the exact UTC instant. The existing zero-date temporal round-trip continues to verify UTC pooled decoding. Run `cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mysql --test integration session_non_utc_time_zone_refuses_mysql_timestamp_instant -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1` and `cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mysql --test integration native_time_zero_date_and_year_values_survive_reads_parameters_and_exports -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1` with Docker available.

Subsequent B3 coverage verifies BIT(1..64), ENUM/SET labels and spatial bytes;
bounded BIT edits survive a driver update, while spatial and too-wide BIT values
remain read-only. Text exports also run with default,
`NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`, `ANSI_QUOTES`, and combined session modes.
Backslash-bearing column comments are explicitly refused. A dedicated-session
Docker regression creates the same DDL under default mode and
`NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`; the server stores one backslash versus two, confirming
that mode-independent output needs session-aware DDL execution. Run it with
`cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mysql --test integration mysql_column_comment_backslash_literals_depend_on_sql_mode -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1`.
I tested reusing the SQL export's `_utf8mb4 X'…'` literal in a generated
`COMMENT` clause; the MySQL server rejects it with syntax error 42000. The DDL
builder therefore continues to refuse backslash comments safely. Supporting
them requires controlled session-mode handling around DDL, including reliable
restoration after errors; ordinary mode-independent string literals are not
accepted by this COMMENT grammar.
Session time-zone and stricter SQL-mode matrices, installed-app-to-MySQL grid
acceptance and broader consumer parity remain open.

### MySQL text and JSON export under ANSI_QUOTES, 2026-09-30

The existing MySQL and MariaDB SQL export round trip also runs with
`ANSI_QUOTES` alone and combined with `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`. It writes
backslash-sensitive text and JSON through generated SQL literals, then checks
source and destination bytes with server-side `HEX()` equality. Default and
`NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES` modes remain in the same matrix. All four mode settings
passed on both MySQL 8 and MariaDB 11; production code did not need a change.
The strict GTK + DuckDB value runner also passed 148 tests across all 11 suites
with no missing suites. Report:
`target/quality/20260930T152649001249Z-values/report.json` (`dirty: true`, based
on `f8efdae`).

```

### MySQL BIT parser, keyed edit and server value contract

The app-level Docker contract reads the actual `bit(1)`, `bit(8)`, `bit(63)`
and `bit(64)` column metadata, parses edits with the grid input parser, builds
the keyed update and writes through the MySQL driver. A false BIT(1), value 170
in BIT(8), and `i64::MAX` in BIT(63) are compared with both decoded results and
MySQL `HEX()` output. A BIT(64) value with its high bit set remains exact bytes;
the parser refuses an edit above the shared signed integer range. GTK-level
tests separately keep such bytes and spatial cells read-only.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_mysql_bit_parser_edits_preserve_native_values -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

The focused Docker contract passed. Installed-app interaction and other MySQL
session modes remain separate acceptance targets. The unignored parser contract
checks BIT(1), (2), (8), (63) and (64) widths, width-specific maxima, negative
input and the shared signed bound. The first mutation run found that the
existing Docker-only test was not selecting a pure parser test. After adding
the unignored contract, the follow-up mutation run caught all 11 remaining
mutants with no survivors or timeouts; evidence is
`target/quality/20260929-mysql-bit-parser-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The strict combined runner passed the app, all seven server drivers, SQLite,
DuckDB and MCP suites on commit `c1b393f8d`: all 123 selected contracts passed
with no missing suites. Evidence is
[`20260929T164906704313Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260929T164906704313Z-values/report.json).

```

### MySQL signed and unsigned integer grid parser, 2026-09-30

The failing-first parser contract found that unsigned metadata such as
`tinyint unsigned` fell through to text parsing, allowing out-of-range digits
to reach permissive sessions. The parser now enforces signed/unsigned ranges
for TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT and BIGINT, accepts MySQL display-width
metadata, preserves the existing `tinyint(1)` boolean convention, and keeps
`BIGINT UNSIGNED` values above `i64::MAX` as exact decimal text up to `u64::MAX`.
The unit matrix checks both boundaries and one-past-range inputs for all widths.
The initial mutation report
`target/quality/20260930-mysql-integer-parser-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`
showed an untested signed INT branch and redundant signed BIGINT special case.

A Docker-backed app contract sets `sql_mode = ''` and independently confirms
that MySQL clamps an invalid `TINYINT UNSIGNED` value of 256 to 255. The parser
refuses that value before the keyed update, while a valid edit stores 255 and
`18446744073709551615` exactly. A second row remains unchanged. The focused
parser test and native-server edit passed. The first scoped mutation run found
the missing signed INT boundaries plus a redundant signed BIGINT arm; the
regression now catches signed INT mutations and the duplicate BIGINT special
case was removed. The final 18-mutant run caught 17, had one compile-time
unviable replacement, and no survivors or timeouts:
`target/quality/20260930-mysql-integer-parser-mutants-final2/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh

```

### MySQL spatial bytes in the GTK grid

The isolated GTK widget contract binds `geometry`, `point` and `multipolygon`
columns containing spatial byte payloads. Each appears as the expected
`<9 bytes>` read-only label, the grid creates no editable `CellEditor`, and
binding the cells emits no pending edit. The widgets layer passed with this
test registered in the isolated-test inventory at clean commit
`2db9f59dc0b1be614440e941baa889f4036bcfb2`; report:
`target/quality/20260929T190108119267Z-layers/report.json`. Scoped mutation testing of the
bytes-specific editability guard caught both generated mutations. A broader
mutation pass also exercised primary-key, generated-column, auto-increment and
`mixed` guards; it left five stricter-read-only survivors because this test only
asserted the spatial refusal. The unignored positive control
`ordinary_text_columns_remain_editable` now verifies regular VARCHAR columns
remain editable, alongside the existing unit contract that spatial values stay
read-only. The full app-library mutation rerun caught all 11 generated
editability mutations, with no survivors, timeouts or unviable mutants. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260929-mysql-spatial-ui-guard-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`
`target/quality/20260929-mysql-spatial-ui-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
and `target/quality/20260929-grid-editability-positive-control-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The strict runner passed 131 selected contracts on clean source
`70206f6fb9a5ce9901ffe4552743e63730100fe0`, with no missing suites:
`target/quality/20260929T214023821465Z-values/report.json` (`dirty: false`).
Installed-app acceptance and server-backed grid interaction remain open.

```

## SQLite dynamic storage-class checkpoint

A new file-backed regression starts a `NUMERIC` column with TEXT, BLOB and NULL
values, then exercises bound edits that transition through REAL, BLOB, TEXT and
INTEGER storage classes. The test checks both SQLite's independent `typeof`
result and TablePro's decoded value. It then exports the edited rows as SQL
INSERT literals, re-imports into a second `NUMERIC` table and requires the same
storage classes and values. This closes the driver-level edit/SQL re-import
case. A policy-guarded CSV import test also covers legal text and numeric values
in INTEGER, REAL and NUMERIC affinity columns. A focused app contract now sends
`42.50` through the same column parser and keyed update builder used for grid
edits, then verifies `typeof(amount) = 'real'` and the returned `42.5` value.
Installed GTK/package acceptance across the storage-class matrix remains open.

The full SQLite integration suite passed all 21 tests. Run locally:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-sqlite --test integration
cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib sqlite_numeric_grid_edit_keeps_parser_and_affinity_behavior -- --test-threads=1
```

The mapped change-contract gate passed this exact app regression at
`target/quality/20260928T130321776497Z-change-contracts/report.json`.

The CSV import contract also checks the integer-form text `42`: SQLite stores
it as INTEGER in INTEGER and NUMERIC columns, and as REAL in the REAL column.
Together with `42.50` and nonnumeric text, this pins the three storage outcomes
after policy-guarded import; all 7 CSV import integration tests passed. A core
unit contract checks that nonnumeric fallback applies only to SQLite for
INTEGER/REAL/NUMERIC columns; MySQL and SQL Server keep rejecting those inputs.
The complete CSV cell-parser mutation scope caught 9 of 12 generated mutants;
the remaining 3 were unviable, with no misses or timeouts. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260930-sqlite-affinity-fallback-mutants-all-cell-tests/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

At clean source SHA `061180e5aab9787e5f5c818ecafb8ec4403b8acb`, the strict
combined value-contract runner passed 147 selected tests across all 11 suites,
with GTK and DuckDB enabled and no missing suites. The quick layer also passed
in 93.1 seconds with a clean worktree. Reports:
[`20260930T141019789442Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T141019789442Z-values/report.json)
and [`20260930T141439236199Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T141439236199Z-layers/report.json).

## MongoDB nested BSON and native boundary checkpoint

A decoder unit regression first failed for nested `Decimal128`, binary and date
values. The driver converted all three to their debug-display strings, losing the
Decimal128 type/precision, binary subtype and exact BSON date milliseconds. Generic
binary values remain `Value::Bytes` for editing. Nested documents/arrays and top-level
non-generic binary values use canonical MongoDB Extended JSON so BSON special types
and subtype metadata remain explicit.

The unit regressions check Decimal128's smallest exponent, largest finite value,
negative zero and scale; every BSON binary subtype, including legacy UUID, encrypted,
column, sensitive, vector, reserved and user-defined values; and dates at both ends
of the signed 64-bit millisecond range. A Docker-backed test checks real UUID and
user-defined subtype values. Top-level Decimal128
values remain exact text because the shared decimal type cannot represent this
range. Dates that cannot be rendered as RFC3339 use canonical Extended JSON with
the exact signed millisecond count. A Docker-backed MongoDB 7 test inserts these
native BSON values directly, reads them through the driver query path, and checks
the resulting value/type representation. Uncommon top-level BSON types now use
canonical Extended JSON instead of display text. Real-server JSON, CSV and XLSX
consumer checks preserve their markers. A Docker-backed grid edit regression
updates a nested document and array through the keyed row update path, then
checks the stored Decimal128, date, binary subtype and integer fields through
the native BSON client. App parser tests route MongoDB object, array and ObjectId
columns through JSON parsing. MongoDB 7 integration tests verify canonical
Extended JSON re-import and MCP browse output preserve nested BSON types.
They also check nested Int64 above 2^53, explicit nested null and Unicode across
driver results, JSON/CSV/XLSX output, import and MCP browse response. An
unignored codec unit regression converts canonical Extended JSON back to native
BSON for Timestamp, regex, JavaScript, code-with-scope, Symbol, ObjectId,
DbPointer, Undefined, MinKey and MaxKey; it complements the Docker-backed
grid-write cases without requiring a server. The same non-ignored test checks
mixed String/Decimal128 identity through the JSON renderer and CSV exporter. A
second non-ignored unit case builds metadata from a String sample, merges a later
Decimal128 page value, and checks that the merged column is `mixed` before that
value is decoded with its canonical BSON marker.
Top-level Timestamp, regex, MinKey, MaxKey, JavaScriptCode, JavaScriptCodeWithScope,
Symbol and DbPointer grid edits round-trip as native BSON. JavaScriptCode is
checked separately without scope; the CodeWithScope regression checks both
stored code and its Int64 scope value; the Symbol and DbPointer regressions read
back native BSON values through the MongoDB client. The mixed String/Decimal128
grid case is covered as a read-only refusal; exact editing remains unsupported.
The current native-server grid matrix covers Timestamp, regex, MinKey, MaxKey,
JavaScriptCode, JavaScriptCodeWithScope, Symbol, Undefined, DbPointer,
Decimal128, top-level ObjectId fields and in-range BSON DateTime edits. The
ObjectId contract keeps `_id` stable, performs a keyed update to the `reference`
field, checks the reloaded `$oid`, then uses an independent MongoDB client to
confirm native ObjectId values. The date contract routes the RFC3339 value shown
in a `date` cell through the driver-aware parser, rejects sub-millisecond input
without changing the row, and verifies a valid offset-origin edit against the
stored BSON millisecond epoch. Other top-level kinds without a named
server-backed edit and collection-wide heterogeneity outside the metadata sample
and returned page remained open at this September 30 checkpoint. The October 3
collection census follow-up below supersedes the latter status for the tested
fixture; scan cost and concurrent-write consistency remain open.

The focused ObjectId grid contract is:

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration value_contracts::value_contract_object_id_grid_edit_preserves_native_bson -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused MongoDB 7 test passed. The clean all-driver selected-contract run
at source tip `63d67fc915e95c87ffbd8c7f781b60ca56a65657` passed 129 tests across
11 suites with no missing suites; MongoDB selected all eight contracts,
including this case. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260929T202504448591Z-values/report.json`. This is selected
contract evidence, not a claim that every crate test or installed UI path ran.

### MongoDB BSON DateTime grid-edit precision

A failing-first parser contract showed the exact RFC3339 value displayed for a
MongoDB `date` column failed with `Invalid date. Use YYYY-MM-DD.` because the
shared parser classified BSON DateTime metadata as date-only. The app now parses
MongoDB RFC3339 date edits as UTC instants, retains offsets and milliseconds,
accepts extra fractional digits only when they are zero, and refuses
sub-millisecond precision before update construction. Date-only input and other
drivers retain their existing parser behavior.

An app-level MongoDB 7 contract seeds a native BSON date, reads its displayed
text, runs the app parser and keyed update builder, then verifies the native
millisecond epoch through an independent MongoDB client. It also checks that a
sub-millisecond edit leaves the original server value unchanged and that a
valid `+05:30` edit preserves the exact UTC instant.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_mongodb_date_parser_preserves_milliseconds_and_refuses_rounding
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_mongodb_date_grid_edit_preserves_millisecond_instant -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

The focused tests passed. Scoped mutation testing of the MongoDB date parser
caught 7 of 8 generated mutations; one default-return mutant was unviable at
compile time, with no misses or timeouts. Its first isolated baseline build hit
the `/tmp` quota before any mutant ran; rerunning with scratch under
`target/mutation-tmp-20260929` completed successfully. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260929-mongodb-date-parser-mutants-home/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The clean strict combined runner passed 131 selected contracts across 11 suites,
no missing suites, at source tip `93d60ea818fe7d4c283bb86440deb7cf2501fe29`.
Both new app contracts appear in the log:
`target/quality/20260929T204726972421Z-values/report.json` (`dirty: false`).

Focused local checks:

```

Against the old decoder, the regression failed with
`Decimal128("...")`, `Binary(...)`, and `DateTime("...")` as JSON strings. Full
MongoDB unit and real-server suites passed (24 unit tests; eight integration
tests). Scoped mutation evidence at
`target/quality/20260927-b3-mongodb-native-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`
records four generated mutations: three caught, one unviable whole-function
replacement (`Value` has no `Default`), and no survivors or timeouts. The failing
pre-fix regressions independently demonstrate test sensitivity. The real-server
test verifies nested Extended JSON through JSON export and parses generated CSV
back into fields to check that quoting preserves the nested object. It also
exports the actual query result as XLSX and checks Decimal128, date and binary
subtype markers in workbook strings. An MCP unit contract confirms BSON
Extended JSON is passed through without flattening; Mongo-backed MCP browse and
native BSON re-import checks now run in the integration suite. Top-level
Timestamp, regex, MinKey, MaxKey, JavaScriptCodeWithScope and Symbol grid edits
are covered; Docker assertions check native CodeWithScope code/scope and Symbol
types after edits. The JavaScriptCode and Undefined cases also verify native
BSON kinds after edits. Local regressions use a BSON
String and Decimal128 with identical text: the field is labeled `mixed`, and
the shared app grid editability gate refuses both values because the result
model previously mapped each scalar to the same `Value::Text`. The grid gate
still refuses editing mixed values. The fix now makes `document_to_row` encode
every value in a `mixed` BSON column as canonical Extended JSON: a BSON String
becomes a JSON string and Decimal128 retains its `$numberDecimal` marker. The
unignored codec unit test checks this distinction through JSON and CSV; the
Docker-backed regression also verifies JSON, CSV and XLSX exports from a real
query and confirms the native BSON values remain distinct in storage.
Browse and `find` metadata starts from a 50-document sample, then incorporates
the bounded documents actually returned on the page. A Docker regression puts
Decimal128 at offset 50 after 50 String values and verifies the returned page's
column is `mixed`; the returned Decimal128 cell carries canonical Extended JSON
while the shared grid gate keeps the column read-only. Heterogeneity outside
both the sample and returned page remains undetected. A separate Docker test
checks that identical BSON String/Decimal128 text remains type-distinct through
the JSON renderer, CSV writer and XLSX workbook:

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration mixed_string_decimal128_exports_preserve_bson_kind -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The contract first failed against the old decoder because CSV flattened both
values to the same text. After the fix, the focused test passed. The full MongoDB
unit suite passed (31 tests), and the Docker-backed integration suite passed (18
tests) on the current worktree. These are local results, not CI evidence. The
earlier MongoDB 7 query/export/import and MCP browse Docker tests passed with
large Int64, null and Unicode values added on 2026-09-28.

A separate homogeneous Decimal128 contract composes the default CSV exporter,
typed CSV parser, and keyed grid update. The decimal column metadata parses the
CSV cell as `Value::Decimal`; after the update, a native BSON read confirms the
field remains `Bson::Decimal128` with the exact original value. This covers a
typed same-schema round trip. The new mixed-column contract independently checks
Extended JSON identity through JSON, CSV and XLSX.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration decimal128_csv_round_trip_through_typed_grid_edit_keeps_native_bson -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused MongoDB 7 Docker contract passed.

### Generic BSON binary grid editing, 2026-09-30

A native MongoDB 7 regression reads a top-level Generic-subtype binary field as
editable `Value::Bytes`, builds the keyed update, and writes different bytes
including NUL and invalid UTF-8. A separate MongoDB client confirms both the
persisted bytes and Generic subtype; the driver then reads back the same byte
sequence. This confirms exact editing for this binary subtype without
converting it to display text or canonical JSON.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration value_contracts::value_contract_generic_binary_grid_edit_preserves_native_bson -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused Docker test passed. Mutation testing of `value_to_bson` first found
ten viable survivors in the naive/UTC date millisecond-alignment guards. A unit
contract now checks exact millisecond bindings and refusal of one-nanosecond
sub-millisecond values for both variants; the rerun caught all 11 generated
mutants, with no misses, timeouts or unviable mutants:
`target/quality/20260930-mongodb-value-to-bson-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

### MongoDB binary subtype grid matrix, 2026-09-30

A Docker-backed keyed-edit contract verifies Generic, Function, BinaryOld,
UUIDOld, UUID, MD5, Encrypted, Sensitive, Vector, Reserved `0a`, and
user-defined `80` subtype values against both canonical driver values and native
BSON subtype/byte oracles. Arbitrary bytes for Column subtype `07` are malformed
and MongoDB rejects them with `NonConformantBSON` (code 378). The test now gets
valid subtype-07 payloads directly from MongoDB time-series buckets: after
closing and reopening each bucket, MongoDB compresses its measurements into a
BSONColumn. The keyed grid edit replaces one valid server-generated column with
another; BookiE and an independent client both confirm exact subtype and payload
preservation. MongoDB's time-series compression description is in the
[server documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/core/timeseries/timeseries-compression/).

The opaque-subtype matrix and positive BSONColumn edit passed:

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration value_contracts::value_contract_binary_subtypes_survive_native_grid_edits -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration value_contracts::value_contract_server_generated_bson_column_survives_grid_edit -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

### MongoDB UUID binary grid editing, 2026-09-30

The existing Generic-subtype edit did not prove subtype-04 UUID binary editing.
The native-server nested/special-value edit contract now changes a top-level
UUID binary field through the keyed update path. A MongoDB client independently
checks that subtype `Uuid` and all 16 bytes survive, while a driver query checks
the canonical Extended JSON value. The focused Docker integration test passed:

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration value_contracts::a_nested_and_max_key_grid_edit_writes_extended_json_back_as_native_bson -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

### MongoDB negative Decimal128 CSV formula marker

The default CSV exporter prefixes negative text cells with an apostrophe to
prevent spreadsheet formula execution. Before the fix, typed CSV import tried
to parse `'-123.45` directly as a decimal and returned `NotANumber`. The core
importer now removes that marker only when the destination column is Decimal
and the remaining cell parses as an exact `rust_decimal::Decimal`; ordinary
text retains the apostrophe. A MongoDB 7 contract exports a native Decimal128,
parses the default sanitized CSV against the `decimal` column metadata, applies
the imported value through a keyed grid update, and confirms the native BSON
value remains exactly Decimal128 `-123.45`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core --lib formula_marker_is_removed_from_negative_decimal_cells_only_for_decimal_columns
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration negative_decimal128_csv_formula_marker_round_trips_as_native_decimal128 -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

Both the focused core regression and MongoDB 7 Docker contract passed.

### MongoDB wide Decimal128 grid edit

A failing-first app parser contract showed that a valid 34-digit Decimal128
value was rejected as `Invalid decimal` because `rust_decimal` has a narrower
range. The MongoDB parser now keeps ordinary in-range decimals on the existing
`Value::Decimal` path and validates wider input with BSON Decimal128. Wider
values travel through the keyed update as canonical `$numberDecimal` Extended
JSON, preserving BSON type and digits. Inputs exceeding Decimal128 precision or
with invalid syntax are refused rather than rounded. The fallback is limited to
MongoDB `decimal` columns.

A MongoDB 7 app contract seeds `9.9900`, edits it to a 34-digit integer through
the app parser and keyed-update builder, then checks the row identity and exact
native `Bson::Decimal128` value through an independent client. Parser tests also
cover a 34-digit fraction, preserved `1.2300` scale, NaN and infinities, invalid
syntax, over-precision refusal, and unchanged MySQL behavior.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --lib decimal128_edit_parser_preserves_native_precision_and_refuses_rounding
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_mongodb_decimal128_parser_preserves_wide_precision
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_mongodb_decimal128_grid_edit_preserves_wide_precision -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

The three focused tests passed. Scoped mutation testing caught 4 of 5 app-parser
mutations; one generated default-return mutant was unviable at compile time.
Both BSON Decimal128 helper mutations were caught. The clean strict runner passed
133 selected tests across all 11 suites at source
`35d457fa488768a5204a26d785c90114073d4acd`, with no missing suites. Evidence:

`target/quality/20260929-mongodb-decimal-driver-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
and `target/quality/20260929T215946474345Z-values/report.json` (`dirty: false`).

Focused local results:

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --lib mixed_scalar_bson_column_is_marked_and_values_remain_visible
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib mixed_bson_columns_are_read_only -- --test-threads=1
```

Both pass. The real-server contract is
`mixed_string_and_decimal128_columns_keep_values_and_refuse_lossy_edit_metadata`:

```sh

Late page sampling is covered by
`browse_page_types_include_documents_after_the_metadata_sample`:

### MongoDB BSON Undefined grid edit

A Docker-backed contract inserts native BSON `Undefined`, verifies the grid
metadata and canonical `{"$undefined":true}` value, applies the shared keyed
row update, then reads the row through both BookiE and the native BSON client.
The persisted value remains `Bson::Undefined`; it does not become null. The
focused MongoDB 7 test passed.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration value_contract_undefined_grid_edit_preserves_native_bson -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

### MongoDB JavaScriptCode grid edit

A BSON JavaScriptCode value is shown in the grid as its canonical `$code`
marker, edited through the shared keyed row update, and checked after reload.
The native MongoDB client confirms that the stored value remains
`Bson::JavaScriptCode` with the edited code string, rather than an ordinary
BSON string.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --test integration value_contract_javascript_code_grid_edit_preserves_native_bson -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused MongoDB 7 Docker contract passed.

## ClickHouse named temporal timezones, 2026-09-27

A live ClickHouse 24.8 regression showed that `DateTime64(6, 'Asia/Tokyo')`
returned a Tokyo wall clock that TablePro decoded as a timezone-free timestamp.
That changed the instant by nine hours. The type metadata contains the IANA zone,
so the decoder now applies timezone rules and returns the corresponding UTC
`TimestampTz`, retaining the fractional seconds.

The decoder refuses unknown zones and local wall-clock strings that fall in DST
gaps or folds. The ClickHouse row format returns a local wall clock without its
offset, so an ambiguous returned value does not identify a unique instant and
must not be guessed. Untagged `DateTime` and `DateTime64` values remain
timezone-free `DateTime` values.

Unit tests cover type wrappers, Tokyo conversion, unknown zones, and New York DST
gaps/folds. A Docker integration test first failed with `DateTime(12:34...)`
instead of the expected `TimestampTz(03:34...Z)`, then passed after the fix. It
also checks that the instant survives a bound parameter and a SQL literal round
trip. The full ClickHouse integration suite passed all 23 cases. The combined `values`
layer passed in 113.058 seconds, `full` passed in 100.8 seconds, and the harness
passed. Reports are in `target/quality/20260927T180959352277Z-layers/`,
`target/quality/20260927T181245187611Z-layers/`, and
`target/quality/20260927T181435128973Z-layers/`.

The named-timezone contract now also checks `Asia/Kathmandu` at
`DateTime64(9)`, with a local time shortly after midnight mapping to the prior
UTC date. The expected instant is fixed independently as
`2026-09-26T18:30:00.123456789Z`; result decoding, typed binding and SQL-literal
round trips all retain nine digits. The focused Docker regression passed. The
strict GTK+DuckDB values layer also passed 169 selected tests across all 11
suites after this expansion:
[`20261001T014227751433Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T014227751433Z-values/report.json).

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration value_contract_datetime64_named_timezone_preserves_the_instant -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

A second Docker regression covers the New York fall-back `DateTime64(3)` local
time `2024-11-03 01:30:00.000`. The server confirms the exact local text and
reports an epoch in one of the two valid fold instants. Because the result wire
text omits which offset was used, BookiE returns `Undecodable`; SQL literal and
parameter consumers refuse it. The focused test passed against ClickHouse
24.8.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration value_contract_ambiguous_datetime64_local_time_is_refused -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

A third server check supplies the nonexistent spring-forward local time
`2024-03-10 02:30:00` to `DateTime64(3, 'America/New_York')`. ClickHouse 24.8
normalizes it to returned local time `01:30:00.000`; the server epoch oracle is
`1710052200000` (`2024-03-10T06:30:00Z`). BookiE decodes that normalized,
unambiguous server result to the exact UTC instant. This tests server behavior
for the supplied expression; it does not preserve the nonexistent civil input.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration value_contract_nonexistent_datetime64_input_matches_server_normalization -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The fall-back contract now also covers Lord Howe Island's 30-minute transition
with `2024-04-07 01:45:00` in `Australia/Lord_Howe`. The unit case requires an
ambiguous-time refusal. ClickHouse's local text and either valid fold epoch are
checked independently; result decoding, SQL literal and parameter consumers
refuse the ambiguous value. The focused unit and Docker contracts passed, then
the strict GTK+DuckDB values layer passed all 190 tests across 11 suites and the
local quick gate passed. The run reused all 747 Cargo artifacts. See the
[review manifest](evidence/b3-review-2026-10-01/manifest.json) for reports and
hosted CI status.

Scoped Rust mutation evidence for `temporal.rs` is in
`target/quality/20260927-ch-temporal-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`:
13 caught, 2 unviable, no survivors or timeouts. The initial mutation pass made
two synthetic wrapper results loop; the progress guard now exits safely and the
repeat has no timeout. Reproduce with:

```sh

```

## ClickHouse `DateTime64(9)` server boundary behavior, 2026-09-29

The Docker contract checks the legal lower endpoint (`1900-01-01`) and upper
endpoint (`2262-04-11 23:47:16.854775807`) against independent
`toUnixTimestamp64Nano` results, including `i64::MAX` at the upper endpoint.
It also records asymmetric server behavior just outside the range. ClickHouse
24.8 accepts `1899-12-31 23:59:59.999999999` but clamps its year to 1900,
returning `1900-01-01 23:59:59.999999999`; the server epoch confirms the
transformed value. The first tested value above the upper endpoint instead
returns a query error.

BookiE refuses both out-of-range values as parameters and SQL literals before
submission. A caller's raw SQL can still invoke ClickHouse's own lower-bound
clamp; the driver cannot recover the original input from the server's valid
result. The test preserves that server behavior explicitly so it cannot be
mistaken for a lossless round trip.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration datetime64_nanosecond_boundaries_pin_server_clamp_and_local_refusal -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused ClickHouse 24.8 Docker contract passed.

### Exact lower-precision DateTime64 bindings, 2026-09-30

A ClickHouse 24.8 native query proved that `DateTime64(0)` accepts
`2299-12-31 23:59:59` and returns the exact millisecond epoch. The driver's
parameter/literal code previously forced scale 9, then refused this value at
the Int64 nanosecond ceiling. The shared renderer now chooses the coarsest
scale that preserves every supplied fractional digit and fits the server
calendar and Int64 ticks. Year 2299 now round-trips through bound parameters and
SQL literals at every exact scale from 0 through 7, with native value and epoch
assertions. Core unit boundaries cover the scale-8 ten-nanosecond edge, the
scale-9 maximum and the first unrepresentable nanosecond. Forcing a value beyond
the scale-9 ceiling through an explicit scale-9 cast still produces a visible
server error; timestamps below the 1900 calendar bound still refuse locally.
The native regression, both focused boundary tests, core/driver unit tests, all
33 ClickHouse Docker integration tests, all 16 final-source scale-range mutants
and all 3 precision-selection mutants passed. Reports:
`target/quality/20260930-clickhouse-scale-precision-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
`target/quality/20260930-clickhouse-scale-selection-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`,
and `target/quality/20260930-clickhouse-scale-range-mutants-final4/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core --lib clickhouse_datetime64_literal_uses_the_coarsest_exact_native_precision
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --lib datetime64_parameters_use_a_wider_exact_scale_when_subseconds_are_zero

rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration datetime64_nanosecond_boundaries_pin_server_clamp_and_local_refusal -- --ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The in-range precision contract was also narrower than its test name: it
previously wrote only scales 0, 3, 6 and 9. It now inserts the same nine-digit
timestamp into `DateTime64(0)` through `DateTime64(9)`, checks each decoded
timestamp against an independently written truncation matrix, and compares each
result's native nanosecond epoch. The focused Docker test passed.
The strict GTK + DuckDB runner passed 156 selected tests across 11 suites with
no missing suites; report: `target/quality/20260930T184141165918Z-values/report.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration value_contract_datetime64_precision_0_through_9_is_exact -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

## DuckDB unsigned boundaries and mixed interval signs, 2026-09-30

The native DuckDB result contract now covers UBIGINT values immediately above
`i64::MAX` and at `u64::MAX`, checking the native type and exact server text as
well as SQL literal and bound-text round trips. The interval contract covers all
eight sign combinations across months, days and microseconds; each case checks
the decoded text, native type, `VARCHAR`, independent `date_part` values, SQL
literal re-import and explicitly cast parameter re-import. The existing decoder
unit contract separately refuses synthetic sub-microsecond interval payloads.

Both focused integration cases passed. Mutation testing ran the decoder's unit
and integration suites together: 11 mutants caught, one unviable, no missed or
timed out mutants. The report is
`target/quality/20260930-duckdb-native-values-mutants-with-unit/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_scalar_hugeints_preserve_exact_text_across_consumers -- --exact --test-threads=1
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_interval_all_component_signs_round_trip_as_exact_text -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

## CSV file import and exact size boundaries, 2026-09-30

The focused import contracts now exercise `read_csv_file` with a real temporary
file, non-default tab delimiter, header handling and preview truncation. A sparse
file one byte over the file cap must be refused from its metadata. Shared file
size validation accepts exactly 64 MiB and refuses one byte more; independent
assertions pin the documented byte, field, column, row and preview limits.
Additional tests accept exactly 512 columns and a 1 MiB field, detect three
column comma/semicolon files, preserve the two-record header rule, and verify
`CsvFormat` conversion. The additive delimiter score was replaced by sampled
width because all delimiter candidates share the same CSV record boundaries.
The focused CSV import tests passed (28 selected). Its scoped 35-mutant run
caught 33, had two compile-time unviable replacements, and no missed or timed
out mutants. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260930-csv-import-boundaries-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core import::csv_import::tests

```

### CSV inference and insert-plan mutation follow-up, 2026-09-30

The hosted core-3 mutation shard found missing assertions around inference and
plan construction. Import inference now proves blank and configured NULL-marker
cells do not widen a numeric column to text. SQLite's bool/int/float/decimal/
bytes type-name mappings are pinned to INTEGER/REAL/NUMERIC/BLOB. Plan tests now
check reported row count, exclude both auto-increment and generated fields from
the plan's columns and bound rows, and keep the SQL and row shapes aligned. The
placeholder plan already uses non-NULL synthetic values, so an explicit
`default_value: None` override was redundant and has been removed.

The focused import suite passed 70 tests. Scoped mutation runs caught 9 of 10
inference mutants (one was compile-time unviable) and 9 of 13 plan mutants (four
were compile-time unviable); neither run had missed mutants or timeouts. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260930-csv-infer-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json` and
`target/quality/20260930-csv-plan-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```

### CSV export quoting and decimal-comma contracts, 2026-09-30

Export tests now check each `IfNeeded` quoting trigger independently: selected
delimiter, embedded quote, a line break replaced by a space, and formula
neutralization. Decimal-comma output accepts signed plain decimals while
preserving exponent forms, missing integer/fraction digits and nonnumeric text.
The focused core CSV export suite passed (16 tests). The scoped mutation run
caught 14 of 15 mutants with no timeout or unviable cases. Its only survivor
deletes `header_row` from the RFC 4180 row-writer options; this is equivalent
because `csv_row_line` never reads that option. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260930-csv-export-contract-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

The streaming/file writer now compares directly with `render_csv` for both
header modes, including comma-decimal, delimiter quoting and line-break
replacement. A separate RFC 4180 header case keeps formula-like column names
unchanged. These regressions caught surviving mutations that omitted CSV
headers or enabled formula sanitization in the plain header writer. The
combined writer/header mutation run caught 5 of 6 mutants with no timeouts or
unviable cases; its only survivor deletes `header_row` from RFC row options,
which is equivalent for row rendering. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260930-csv-stream-and-rfc-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.
The current strict value-contract run passed 146 tests across all 11 selected
suites with GTK and DuckDB enabled, no missing suites, 709 fresh artifacts and
17 rebuilt packages. The quick layer also passed. Reports:
`target/quality/20260930T132204286258Z-values/report.json` and
`target/quality/20260930T131958872775Z-layers/report.json`.

```

### Single-row JSON export, 2026-09-30

The public `row_to_json` consumer now has its own direct contract. It compares a
wide integer above 2^53, a BSON Decimal128 Extended JSON marker, a boolean and
SQL NULL with the expected JSON object. This closes a mutation survivor where
`row_to_json` could return an empty/default JSON value while `render_json`
tests still passed. The focused test passed, and its scoped mutation run caught
both generated mutations with no misses, timeouts or unviable cases. The strict
shared-value layer then passed 145 tests across 11 suites with GTK and DuckDB
enabled and no missing suites; the quick layer also passed. The strict report is
`target/quality/20260930T130742944866Z-values/report.json`. Evidence:
`target/quality/20260930-single-row-json-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-core --lib value_contract_single_row_json_export_preserves_value_types

```

## SQL Server DATE, TIME and DATETIME2 calendar edges, 2026-09-30

A Docker-backed contract compares DATE year 0001/year 9999, TIME(7) minimum/
maximum and DATETIME2(7) minimum/maximum calendar values against independent
SQL Server text. It checks exact `Value::Date`, `Value::Time` and
`Value::DateTime` results, including the final 100 ns fractions, then binds
those values as parameters and exports/re-imports them as SQL literals. Native
text, decoded values and re-imported values must all agree. This narrows the
temporal gap for these three types; it does not establish support for
conversions outside chrono's range or other SQL Server temporal families. No
production defect was found.

The focused Docker test and the complete SQL Server integration suite passed;
the latter ran 32 tests in 166.73 seconds. The earlier targeted decoder mutation
run generated
one unviable mutant and no viable missed mutants, so it provides no additional
test-sensitivity evidence.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-driver-mssql --test integration temporal_boundaries::value_contract_supported_temporal_calendar_edges_match_native_text_and_bind_exactly -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1

```

### MySQL repeated-semicolon script delimiter consumer contract, 2026-09-30

An editor-level regression uses `DELIMITER ;;` around a procedure containing
multiple semicolon-terminated body statements, followed by a delimiter reset
and a parameterized SELECT. Planner and execution statement extraction must
return exactly the routine and trailing query; the body placeholder must not
be extracted, the trailing placeholder must be preserved, and formatting then
replanning must retain the same two statements. This extends the existing
`$$` and `//` contracts to a delimiter that contains the ordinary SQL
semicolon. No planner or formatter defect was found.

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked -p tablepro-app --lib mysql_repeated_semicolon_delimiter_keeps_body_statements_together -- --test-threads=1
```

## DuckDB temporal filter precision, 2026-09-30

The shared filter builder now rejects predicates whose fractional input exceeds
the target DuckDB temporal type's precision. Equality, both `BETWEEN` bounds,
and each `IN` member use the same guard. TIME/TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ accept
microseconds; `TIMESTAMP_S` and `TIMESTAMP_MS` enforce seconds and milliseconds.
`TIME_NS` and `TIMESTAMP_NS` retain nanosecond inputs. Exact millisecond and
nanosecond values remain accepted. This prevents filter parameters from silently
matching a rounded or truncated instant.

The first regression run failed before the guard existed because a sub-
microsecond TIME value was accepted. After the fix, the focused core contract
passed, then the strict GTK+DuckDB runner passed all 11 suites (156 tests):
[`20260930T185810190323Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T185810190323Z-values/report.json).
Scoped mutation testing of `parse_filter_value` caught 11 mutants; one mutation
was unviable. The guard is in shared filter construction; driver-specific
comparison semantics beyond DuckDB remain covered by the existing driver suites.
The same strict runner was rerun on corrected, pushed SHA
`1a8d9f459c5707f512b72ad77b04ed6921e56039`; all 156 selected tests again passed
across all 11 suites:
[`20260930T192623654872Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T192623654872Z-values/report.json).

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-core duckdb_temporal_filters_refuse_values_the_column_would_truncate -- --nocapture
```

Embedded DuckDB integration tests now exercise filter output through real
parameter binding and native column comparisons. They check server-reported
`TIMESTAMP_MS`, `TIMESTAMP_NS`, `TIME_NS`, and `TIMESTAMPTZ` metadata and values;
the exact millisecond predicate selects only its matching row, while
sub-millisecond `TIMESTAMP_MS` and `TIMESTAMPTZ` predicates refuse before
execution. Nanosecond TIME/TIMESTAMP filters select their exact values through
the driver's lossless text fallback. An offset-origin TIMESTAMPTZ filter keeps
the exact instant through text binding and an `epoch_us` native oracle.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_temporal_filter_parameters_keep_duckdb_column_precision_end_to_end -- --exact --nocapture
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_time_ns_filter_uses_exact_text_fallback -- --exact --nocapture
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_timestamptz_filter_preserves_offset_origin_instant -- --exact --nocapture
```

### DuckDB sub-microsecond parameter expression boundary, 2026-10-01

Nanosecond `Time` and `DateTime` parameters use exact VARCHAR fallback because
the pinned Rust binding reduces native nanosecond values to microseconds.
Explicit casts to `TIME_NS` and `TIMESTAMP_NS` compare equal to exact native
nanosecond literals. The pinned DuckDB runtime rejects `TIME_NS + INTERVAL`
even after the cast, so that expression remains an explicit server limitation rather than
being coerced to microsecond `TIME`. `TimestampTz` remains canonical RFC3339
text, including all nine digits and the UTC instant. Grid edits to lower-
precision `TIMESTAMPTZ` columns continue to refuse sub-microsecond values.

The focused integration contract passed. Scoped mutation testing of
`time_param` and `timestamp_param` caught 8 of 10 generated changes; two were
unviable, with no missed or timed-out mutants. The strict GTK+DuckDB selector
passed 164 tests across all 11 suites, including 22 DuckDB tests:

The mutation report is
[`outcomes.json`](../target/quality/20261001-duckdb-temporal-bind-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json).
The quick layer passed after the integration test was split into a support
module to satisfy the file-size guard:
[`20260930T224147348085Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T224147348085Z-layers/report.json).

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration submicro_parameter_expression::value_contract_submicro_text_parameters_keep_precision_after_explicit_casts -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

The focused DuckDB crate passed all 41 tests. The strict value runner selects
integration tests by the `value_contract` name prefix. Its first rerun reported
17 DuckDB tests and omitted the first new case; renaming it to follow the
selection contract made it the 18th DuckDB case. After adding TIME_NS and
TIMESTAMPTZ native filter cases, the strict run selected 20 DuckDB contracts
and passed all 159 tests across 11 suites, with no missing suites:
[`20260930T195202641431Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T195202641431Z-values/report.json).

## DuckDB nested UHUGEINT refusal boundaries, 2026-09-30

The DuckDB gap audit added nested wide unsigned cases for a
`STRUCT(amount UHUGEINT)` value and a list of that struct. Independent native
`typeof` and `VARCHAR` results pin the full value `18446744073709551616`; the
BookiE result must be `Undecodable`, and SQL-literal and bound-parameter
consumers must refuse it. This expands explicit safe refusal to these two shapes
without claiming general nested collection support.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration value_contract_nested_uhugeint_struct_shapes_refuse_lossy_consumers -- --exact --nocapture
```

The focused native DuckDB case passed.
After adding this contract, the full DuckDB crate passed 42 tests and the strict
GTK+DuckDB runner passed all 160 selected tests across 11 suites, including 21
DuckDB contracts:
[`20260930T200423574515Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T200423574515Z-values/report.json).

## DuckDB nested UBIGINT array refusal, 2026-10-02

The scalar decoder preserves `UBIGINT` values above `i64::MAX`, but the nested
unsigned matrix did not include a `UBIGINT[]`. This contract uses
`i64::MAX + 1`, `u64::MAX` and SQL NULL. DuckDB `typeof` and `VARCHAR` projections
pin the native type and exact array text; BookiE marks the result `Undecodable`,
and SQL-literal and bound-parameter consumers refuse it. This records the
current safe boundary without claiming nested-array support.

```sh
rtk cargo test -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration bigint_array::value_contract_nested_ubigint_array_refuses_lossy_consumers -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

The clean strict GTK+DuckDB layer passed 186 selected tests across 11 suites,
including 24 DuckDB contracts, with no missing suites on `6c2e61f`. See the
[layer report](../target/quality/20261002T003009990931Z-layers/report.json)
and [suite details](../target/quality/20261002T003010044333Z-values/report.json).
Other nested unsigned shapes remain open.

## DuckDB nested UBIGINT struct refusal, 2026-10-02

This contract extends the nested unsigned boundary to a STRUCT with
`i64::MAX + 1`, `u64::MAX` and a NULL field. DuckDB `typeof` and `VARCHAR`
provide independent type and exact-value oracles. BookiE returns
`Undecodable`, and SQL-literal and bound-parameter consumers refuse the value.
The focused embedded-engine test and clean strict GTK+DuckDB value layer passed
on `19c5b6a`: 187 tests across all 11 suites, including 25 DuckDB contracts.
Other nested unsigned shapes remain open.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration bigint_struct::value_contract_nested_ubigint_struct_refuses_lossy_consumers -- --exact --test-threads=1
```

The report is

## DuckDB nested UBIGINT map refusal, 2026-10-02

The native map contract now also covers `MAP(VARCHAR, UBIGINT)` with
`i64::MAX + 1`, `u64::MAX` and SQL NULL. DuckDB's independent `typeof` and
`VARCHAR` projections pin the type and exact `{key=value}` representation;
BookiE returns `Undecodable`, and SQL-literal and bound-parameter consumers
refuse the value. The focused test, clean strict GTK+DuckDB layer (188 tests,
11 suites, 26 DuckDB contracts) and local quick CI gate passed on `efcbec7`.
Other nested unsigned shapes remain open.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration bigint_map::value_contract_nested_ubigint_map_refuses_lossy_consumers -- --exact --test-threads=1

## DuckDB nested UHUGEINT fixed-array refusal, 2026-10-02

The fixed-size array boundary now has a wide-value contract for
`UHUGEINT[2]`, containing `18446744073709551616` and SQL NULL. Native
`typeof`/`VARCHAR` projections pin the fixed-array type and exact text; BookiE
returns `Undecodable` and SQL-literal/bound-parameter consumers refuse it. The
focused test passed. The strict GTK+DuckDB layer passed 189 tests across all 11
suites, including 27 DuckDB contracts, and local quick CI passed on `98611db`.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration fixed_uhugeint_array::value_contract_nested_uhugeint_fixed_array_refuses_lossy_consumers -- --exact --test-threads=1

## DuckDB nested UHUGEINT UNION refusal, 2026-10-02

The nested unsigned boundary now covers `UNION(value := 18446744073709551616::UHUGEINT)`.
DuckDB's native `typeof` and `VARCHAR` projections pin the result as
`UNION("value" UHUGEINT)` with exact decimal text. BookiE returns `Undecodable`,
and SQL-literal and bound-parameter consumers refuse it. The focused regression,
strict GTK+DuckDB layer (190 tests, 11 suites, no missing suites) and local
quick gate passed. The strict run reused 746 artifacts and rebuilt only the
DuckDB package.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-duckdb --test integration uhugeint_union::value_contract_nested_uhugeint_union_refuses_lossy_consumers -- --exact --test-threads=1

Hosted Build, Security and Flatpak workflows passed on docs tip `6e45fbf`.

## MySQL spatial grid edit refusal, 2026-09-30

The grid's GTK path rendered spatial bytes read-only, but direct driver-aware
edit parsing still accepted text for those same columns. A failing-first parser
contract reproduced this for `geometry`; it now requires refusal for all eight
MySQL spatial types. The Docker-backed app contract creates GEOMETRY, POINT and
MULTIPOLYGON rows, verifies native geometry type/WKT/HEX values, tries each
spatial edit through the parser, and confirms the native values and both row
identities remain unchanged.

Scoped mutation testing of `parse_mysql_spatial_input` caught two mutants; one
was unviable, with no missed or timed-out mutants. The strict GTK+DuckDB runner
passed all 162 selected tests across 11 suites, including the new parser and
live-server app contracts:
[`20260930T203202118084Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T203202118084Z-values/report.json).

```

## MongoDB in-flight cancellation and disconnect classification, 2026-09-30

A local TCP fixture accepts MongoDB's connection and holds it open after the
read starts. Cancelling the operation must return
`OperationOutcomeUnknown(Cancelled)`, not `Disconnected`; this distinguishes an
interrupted request with an unknown server outcome from confirmed transport
loss. The focused contract passed, and the complete MongoDB library suite passed
36 tests. The strict value runner passed 162 selected contracts across 11
suites; the library cancellation test was verified separately from that
runner's integration-test selection:
[`20260930T210700047035Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T210700047035Z-values/report.json).

```sh
rtk cargo test --locked --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --lib value_contract_mongodb_cancelled_inflight_read_is_unknown_not_disconnected -- --nocapture
rtk cargo test --locked --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-mongodb --lib
```

## MySQL unsigned edit across session SQL modes, 2026-09-30

The existing contract set `SESSION sql_mode` through the pooled connection API,
then assumed later calls used that same physical connection. A new assertion
exposed the mismatch: the pool reset/reused a session with the server's default
mode. The contract now pins each mode with `open_session()`. In permissive mode,
MySQL demonstrates that `TINYINT UNSIGNED` value 256 clamps to 255. In a pinned
`STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` session, the native insert rejects 256, the app parser
refuses the same out-of-range grid edit, and a valid keyed edit still preserves
255 plus `BIGINT UNSIGNED` max while leaving the neighboring row unchanged.
The focused Docker contract passed. The strict GTK+DuckDB value runner passed
162 selected tests across 11 suites:
[`20260930T210700047035Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T210700047035Z-values/report.json).

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-app --lib value_contract_mysql_unsigned_integer_grid_edits_refuse_coercion_and_preserve_u64 -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

## ClickHouse nested decimal and temporal value, 2026-09-30

The native nested-value matrix now includes an array of tuples containing
`Decimal(38, 9)` and nanosecond `DateTime64(9, 'UTC')`. The contract compares
BookiE's decoded JSON with ClickHouse `toJSONString` and checks `toTypeName`
before verifying that SQL export, typed parameters and keyed grid editing
refuse the type-less nested value without changing the stored MergeTree row.
The focused Docker contract passed. Scoped mutation testing of `json_to_value`
caught 9 of 10 generated mutations; one was compile-time unviable, with no
survivors or timeouts. The strict GTK+DuckDB value runner passed 162 tests
across 11 suites, including the expanded ClickHouse case:
[`20260930T213122442487Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T213122442487Z-values/report.json).
The quick layer also passed:
[`20260930T213517124497Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T213517124497Z-layers/report.json).

The same server-backed contract was extended with an
`Array(Tuple(String, Array(Nullable(Decimal(38, 9)))))` value. Its independent
native JSON result preserves a high-precision Decimal, a NULL array element,
and an empty nested array. SQL export, parameter binding and keyed edit still
refuse type-less JSON, with exact native row equality after the refusal. The
JSON and CSV exports are parsed back through their consumers and compared with
the same native JSON oracle, preserving the nested value for downstream use.
The focused Docker case and strict GTK+DuckDB selector passed 164 tests across
11 suites:
[`20260930T224745418261Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T224745418261Z-values/report.json).
The quick layer also passed:
[`20260930T225139833836Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T225139833836Z-layers/report.json).

```sh

```

### ClickHouse nested Map of tuple arrays, 2026-10-01

The same native-backed consumer contract now includes
`Map(String, Array(Tuple(String, Nullable(Decimal(38, 9)))))` with an empty
array, a NULL decimal and a high-precision decimal. It checks `toTypeName` and
`toJSONString`, then compares the driver value and parsed JSON/CSV exports with
that independent server oracle. The SQL literal, typed parameter and MergeTree
grid consumers must refuse the type-less nested value without changing the
stored row. The focused Docker case passed. Other nested combinations remain
open; this increases the matrix from nine tested shapes to ten, rather than
closing the broader nested-type audit. The strict values runner passed all 165
selected tests across 11 suites, including the expanded ClickHouse contract:
[`20260930T231755592573Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T231755592573Z-values/report.json).

### ClickHouse tuple containing a nullable-decimal map, 2026-10-01

The native-backed consumer contract now also covers
`Tuple(String, Map(String, Nullable(Decimal(38, 9))))`, including one exact
high-precision decimal and a NULL map value. The same test verifies the driver
result and parsed JSON/CSV against `toTypeName` and `toJSONString`, refuses SQL
literal, binding and grid writes without native type metadata, and confirms the
stored MergeTree row is unchanged. It now also covers
`Array(Map(String, Nullable(Decimal(38, 9))))` with the same decimal and NULL
values through those consumers. The focused Docker contract passed after both
shapes were added. This adds the twelfth nested shape; other nested combinations and broader consumer
parity remain open.

### ClickHouse numeric-key nullable map, 2026-10-02

The same server-backed contract now covers
`Map(UInt8, Nullable(UInt128))`, with key `255` mapped to NULL and key `1` mapped
to `18446744073709551616`. It checks ClickHouse's native type and JSON oracles,
the driver and parsed JSON/CSV consumers, and refusal by SQL literal, parameter
binding and keyed grid edit while confirming the MergeTree row is unchanged.
The focused Docker test and strict GTK+DuckDB value layer passed; the layer ran
186 tests across all 11 suites, including this contract. The report is
[`20261002T004142618874Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261002T004142618874Z-values/report.json).
This was the thirteenth nested shape; other nested combinations remained open.

### ClickHouse numeric-key map of nullable UInt128 arrays, 2026-10-02

The shared Docker contract now includes
`Map(UInt8, Array(Nullable(UInt128)))`, with a wide unsigned value and NULL in
one array plus an empty array under another key. ClickHouse `toTypeName` and
`toJSONString` provide native type and value oracles. Parsed JSON/CSV output
preserves the exact nested value; SQL literal, parameter and MergeTree grid
edit paths refuse it, and the stored row remains unchanged. The focused Docker
test, strict GTK+DuckDB layer (190 tests, all 11 suites) and local quick gate
passed. The strict run reused 745 artifacts and rebuilt ClickHouse and DuckDB.

```sh
rtk cargo test --manifest-path linux/Cargo.toml -p tablepro-driver-clickhouse --test integration nested_values::value_contract_nested_collections_keep_exact_json_and_refuse_lossy_consumers -- --include-ignored --exact --test-threads=1
```

The strict report is

The reversed nesting order, `Array(Map(UInt8, Nullable(UInt128)))`, is also
covered with the same >`u64::MAX` value and SQL NULL. The native oracle and the
shared refusal/preservation checks pass through the same contract. The focused
Docker test and strict values layer passed; the quick gate passed when run with
loopback socket permission for existing MongoDB tests. Reports:
[`20261002T124905277939Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261002T124905277939Z-values/report.json)

## MongoDB late-page heterogeneity blocks grid editing, 2026-09-30

The first 50 documents declare a field as string; the next fetched page contains
a Decimal128 value for that field. A Docker-backed app contract obtains the
initial metadata and later page from MongoDB, merges the page schema through
`columns_for_browse_page`, and verifies the conflicting value marks the column
`mixed`, invalidates the cached grid layout, and fails the actual inline-edit
gate. A native MongoDB client confirms the Decimal128 value and row identity are
unchanged. This proves safety for each fetched page; it does not claim a global
type census for documents outside the current page.

The test passed in `20260930T215342621227Z-values/report.json`: 26 app tests and
163 tests across all 11 configured suites, including GTK and DuckDB. The quick
layer passed at the same source revision; see
[`20260930T215742792833Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20260930T215742792833Z-layers/report.json).

Scoped mutation testing of `columns_for_browse_page` passed its clean app-test
baseline. Three behavior-changing mutants were caught; three generated mutants
were unviable, with no missed or timed-out mutants. The isolated-copy attempt
ran no mutants because its duplicate GTK build exhausted temporary disk quota;
the retained in-place run reused the workspace target:
[`outcomes.json`](../target/quality/20261001-mongodb-page-schema-mutants-inplace/mutants.out/outcomes.json).

## PostgreSQL built-in array CSV INSERT matrix, 2026-10-01

The typed CSV INSERT path now has a live PostgreSQL round trip for all 20
array families in its static cast allowlist: boolean, bytea, name, integer
widths, oid, text, float, character types, numeric, UUID, date/time variants,
timestamps and intervals. The CSV is rendered and parsed through the shared
consumers, then `build_insert_plan` binds the exact array text through its
catalog-derived casts. Every target array is checked against both its native
text and `array_send` wire bytes. The fixtures include NULL and empty elements,
binary bytes, Unicode/newlines, numeric scale and specials, float subnormals,
temporal infinities/offsets, extended dates and mixed-sign intervals.

The focused Docker test passed one test with 64 filtered. The strict GTK+DuckDB
value runner passed 175 tests across all 11 suites, with no missing suites;
the PostgreSQL suite ran 37 selected tests, including this case. The full
disconnect/driver layer also passed 223 tests on the clean base commit before
this test-only addition. Evidence:
[`20261001T031547325812Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T031547325812Z-layers/report.json),
[`20261001T025640026732Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T025640026732Z-layers/report.json).
After adding the Docker case to the ignored-test inventory, the quick gate
passed as well:
[`20261001T032311403470Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T032311403470Z-layers/report.json).

The production cast mapping did not change in this checkpoint; its earlier
scoped mutation run caught all 26 generated mutations. The new live-server
matrix closes the gap that mapping tests could not prove: each static cast
actually inserts the driver's exported text as the correct PostgreSQL array.

## DuckDB interval CSV import, 2026-10-01

A failing-first embedded DuckDB contract found two importer bugs. The shared
catalog classifier treated `INTERVAL` as an integer because its name contains
`int`; after preserving interval cells as text, formula-safe CSV still prefixed
negative interval text, and an empty interval cell was mistaken for empty text
instead of SQL NULL. The importer now restores the leading marker only for
canonical DuckDB interval text with valid singular/plural units. With the
default empty null marker, an empty interval field becomes NULL; with a custom
marker, an empty interval literal is rejected. The classifier also keeps the
unrelated `POINT` catalog type as text.

The live CSV export/parse/`build_insert_plan`/INSERT test covers all eight
month/day/microsecond sign combinations, the month/day/microsecond carrier
extrema, zero and NULL. It compares exact imported values, `typeof`, native
`VARCHAR`, and independent `date_part` results for months, days and
microseconds. The focused contract passed. The strict GTK+DuckDB runner passed
176 tests across all 11 suites, with no missing suites; quick passed as well.
Mutation testing initially found three untested invalid unit spellings. After
adding them, the final scoped run caught 29/30 mutants, with one unviable and
none missed or timed out. Evidence:
[`20261001T040526500083Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T040526500083Z-layers/report.json),

## ClickHouse Int128/UInt128 XLSX preservation, 2026-10-01

The ClickHouse wide-integer contract already verifies signed `Int128` minimum
and maximum plus `UInt128` maximum through native results, SQL literals,
parameters, CSV and grid edits. The shared XLSX writer test now includes these
three values as `Value::Text` and inspects the workbook XML to require exact
shared-string cells, preventing spreadsheet numeric conversion from losing
digits. A separate JSON contract requires them to remain exact JSON strings,
since JSON numbers cannot safely represent the full 128-bit range. Both focused
core tests passed. Scoped mutation testing of `write_cell`
and this contract caught all 15 generated mutants, with no misses, timeouts or
unviable mutations. The report is
[`outcomes.json`](../target/quality/20261001-clickhouse-int128-xlsx-mutants/mutants.out/outcomes.json).
The strict GTK+DuckDB value layer passed 177 tests across all 11 suites, with no
missing suites, and the quick layer passed. Reports:

## PostgreSQL unlisted built-in array refusal matrix, 2026-10-01

The binary array decoder allowlist did not have server-backed refusal evidence
for several built-in element OIDs even where scalar decoding is exact. A live
Docker contract now checks `inet[]`, `cidr[]`, `macaddr[]`, `macaddr8[]`,
`pg_lsn[]`, `bit[]`, and `bit varying[]`. For each, it requires a typed
`Undecodable` marker, verifies PostgreSQL's `pg_typeof` and array text against
fixed expected values, compares `array_to_json` with its native expected JSON,
and confirms SQL literal and parameter consumers refuse the value. This makes
the unsupported boundary explicit without claiming exact array support. The
focused Docker test passed all seven cases:
`array_contract::value_contract_unlisted_builtin_arrays_refuse_with_native_oracles`.
The complete PostgreSQL integration target passed 67 tests with
`--include-ignored --test-threads=1`. The strict GTK+DuckDB value layer then
passed 178 selected tests across all 11 suites, with no missing suites; its
PostgreSQL suite ran 38 selected tests and the log confirms this case ran.
Harness and quick also passed. Reports:

## PostgreSQL built-in array OID census, 2026-10-01

A live catalog census now visits built-in array types, checks PostgreSQL's
`pg_typeof`, array text, and `array_to_json` oracles, then compares directly
decodable arrays against the decoder allowlist and checks SQL-consumer behavior.
It records 22 exact driver-level blockers instead of silently skipping them:
composite catalog arrays fail SQLx metadata decoding (`typcategory`, code 90),
multirange arrays fail SQLx type decoding (`typtype`, code 109), and
`aclitem[]`/`gtsvector[]` fail with PostgreSQL SQLSTATE 42883 because no binary
output function exists. Each blocker has server-side native oracles. The known
set is asserted exactly so new driver errors fail the census. `name[]` is checked
separately because its catalog row does not appear in this array enumeration.
This establishes refusal/blocker evidence; it does not add support for these
arrays or resolve the SQLx/PostgreSQL binary-protocol limitations.
The focused test passed against the local Docker PostgreSQL fixture. The full
PostgreSQL integration target passed 68 tests; harness/quick passed, and strict
GTK+DuckDB value validation passed 179 tests across all 11 suites with no missing
suites. Reports: [`20261001T064515312579Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T064515312579Z-values/report.json),

## MongoDB Int32 grid edits preserve BSON width, 2026-10-01

A failing-first live app contract found that BSON `int` cells decode to the shared
`Value::Int` and were rebound as BSON Int64. It also found the parser accepted
values beyond Int32 and could let MongoDB change the stored numeric value. For
MongoDB `int` columns, grid parsing now checks the signed Int32 bounds and emits
canonical Extended JSON `$numberInt`; `long` columns remain exact Int64. The live
contract edits both widths through the app parser and keyed-update builder, checks
row identity and native BSON kinds, and verifies overflowing Int32 input is refused
with the stored Int32 unchanged. The parser unit contract checks both Int32
boundaries, adjacent overflow, Int64 min/max and values above 2^53, and keeps other
drivers on their existing path. The first live regression failed because Int32
overflow was accepted; after the fix the focused live and parser tests passed.
The full strict GTK+DuckDB layer passed 181 tests across all 11 suites with no
missing suites. A scoped run caught all four viable parser mutants; one generated
whole-function replacement was unviable, with no misses or timeouts. Reports:
[`20261001T071947669210Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T071947669210Z-values/report.json), [`20261001T072421865121Z-layers/report.json`](../target/quality/20261001T072421865121Z-layers/report.json), and [`mutation outcomes`](../target/quality/20261001-mongodb-integer-width-mutants-final/mutants.out/outcomes.json).

## PostgreSQL extended temporal consumer support (October 3)

PostgreSQL DATE values outside Chrono's calendar and upper finite TIMESTAMP /
TIMESTAMPTZ values now retain exact text through results, SQL literals, typed
casts, CSV import and app keyed edits. A native send-byte oracle checks the
result and persisted edit; the app contract also checks the full row key and an
unchanged sibling. Year 1,000,000 DATE and year 294276 upper timestamps have
consumer coverage. The maximum finite DATE `5874897-12-31` has result, literal
and binding byte checks. These cases use exact text fallback; they do not prove
generic PostgreSQL custom-type support.

## PostgreSQL BC and extended-year CSV import (October 3)

The default sanitized CSV import contract covers BC, AD, year 9999, year 10000
and SQL NULL for DATE, TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMPTZ, then compares PostgreSQL's
native send bytes after import. The first full values run found that Chrono's
valid leading `+` for year 10000 was rejected; after fixing validation and
canonicalizing the year before PostgreSQL binding, the focused Docker test
`date_contract::value_contract_bc_dates_survive_default_csv_import` passed.
The strict GTK+DuckDB values layer passed 196 selected tests across all 11
suites, with no missing suites, on the merged working tree (`origin/linux` at
`6346a431c` integrated on top of `cdcfcb0`). This report records a dirty
worktree before the merge commit:
[`20261003T002033438424Z-values/report.json`](../target/quality/20261003T002033438424Z-values/report.json).

## DuckDB extended calendar and TIMESTAMPTZ consumer support (October 3)

DATE32 edges and DATE/TIMESTAMP values outside Chrono's calendar retain exact
text. Results, SQL literals, parameters, CSV import and keyed edits are checked
against DuckDB's native text/epoch oracles. Extended TIMESTAMPTZ also preserves
its UTC offset and offset-origin instant through those consumers. Installed GTK,
arbitrary nested collection combinations and native sub-microsecond bindings
remain outside this evidence.

## MongoDB collection-wide heterogeneity blocks grid editing (October 3)

`fetch_columns` scans the collection and marks a field `mixed` when a late
Decimal128 conflicts with earlier strings. The app Docker contract verifies
first-page String and later-page Decimal128 cells remain read-only, checks the
`$numberDecimal` marker and confirms the persisted BSON kind and row identity.
The driver contract checks the late-page value through browse and query. This
proves the named fixture; full-scan cost and concurrent writes during the scan
remain risks. The October 3 follow-up below closes the separate census/page
command gap for browse rows, but does not add snapshot semantics.

### MongoDB missing fields remain distinct from BSON null (October 3)

A native sparse-document contract first failed because the driver returned
`Value::Null` both for an explicit BSON null and for a field absent from a
document. The driver now returns `Value::Undecodable("missing BSON field")`
for the absent field, which stays visibly distinct and cannot be rebound as an
explicit null. The test independently reads both source documents through the
MongoDB client, then checks the driver query result by `_id`. The focused Docker
regression and the full driver package test run passed (65 tests across three
suites). This closes the representation conflation without claiming a general
missing-value type in the shared model. Collection census cost and concurrent
writes during the scan remain open. Commands, initial failure, and fingerprints
are in the [case manifest](evidence/mongodb-missing-null-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

## MCP CSV null markers preserve PostgreSQL enum values (October 3)

CSV file and MCP `export_data` outputs include a null marker chosen to be absent
from exported values. The marker starts at `\\N` and appends `N` until it no
longer collides, so enum labels `\\N` and `\\NN` remain text. The app shows
the marker in its CSV export dialog, and its import dialog accepts the same
value. Native PostgreSQL contracts import the exact MCP response and core file
output into schema-aware enum targets, checking literal `NULL`, empty text,
Unicode, SQL NULL, marker-shaped labels, formula-shaped text in raw mode, and
`pg_typeof`. Formula-shaped text is prefixed when spreadsheet-safe export is on;
turning it off preserves the literal value for import. The ordinary blank
format remains safe: enum import refuses it as ambiguous before any write.
Clipboard CSV formatting and broader enum format/session coverage remain
separate cases. This does not add an MCP import tool.
Commands and fingerprints are in the
[PostgreSQL enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

## Spreadsheet-safe PostgreSQL enum CSV is not reversible (October 3)

A PostgreSQL 16 regression adds both formula-shaped enum label =1+1 and the
distinct literal label '=1+1. Spreadsheet-safe export prefixes the first label
with an apostrophe, producing the same CSV field for both source values. The
schema-aware importer treats both fields as exact enum text, and PostgreSQL
stores the apostrophe-prefixed label for both rows. This is a valid native enum
value but a lossy restore. Raw-text export preserves both labels and remains the
tested lossless import path. The export dialog now says to turn spreadsheet
safety off for lossless re-import. See the native selector and retained output
in the [PostgreSQL enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

## PostgreSQL domain over enum value consumers — 2026-10-03

A PostgreSQL 16 native regression creates a domain over a custom enum and
projects its literal `NULL` label, Unicode label and SQL NULL. The driver returns
exact text/NULL values while the independent `pg_typeof` column reports the
domain type. A companion array contract covers literal `NULL`, empty text,
Unicode, a comma-containing label and an SQL NULL element; `array_to_json` and
`pg_typeof` provide independent native value/type oracles. It initially failed
because the binary decoder treated the domain element OID as unsupported. The
array decoder now follows domain metadata to its enum base and returns exact
PostgreSQL array text. The focused contract and full PostgreSQL integration
suite passed. A separate native contract binds text and SQL NULL through an
explicit domain cast, then updates a domain column and verifies the stored
label and `pg_typeof`. This tests explicit-cast parameter and update consumers;
implicit equality between two domain values is unsupported by PostgreSQL and
is not claimed. A failing-first assignment-context test reproduced SQLSTATE
42804 because the driver bound a server-inferred domain parameter as text. The
parameter describer now follows domain metadata to the enum base; an uncast
text update and SQL NULL update both preserve the domain type and leave a
same-table sibling unchanged. Structured equality/IN/IS NULL filters cast the
domain column and values through the base enum; native results verify exact
labels, SQL NULL, and the domain type. The catalog metadata also feeds keyed
updates and draft inserts, with the server verifying the stored domain type. A
raw CSV round-trip exports a domain-over-enum column with an explicit `\\N` NULL
marker and imports literal `NULL`, empty text, Unicode and SQL NULL into the
domain. The default blank representation is refused before any target rows are
written; the imported values and native domain type are checked against native
expected rows. Shared JSON rendering and the JSON result-file writer preserve
the domain labels and SQL NULL as JSON strings/null, with `pg_typeof` confirming
the source type. Domain XML/HTML/Markdown/XLSX/SQL/MCP exports, parameter
inference outside assignment writes and nested domain chains remain untested.
Exact commands and results are in the
[enum evidence manifest](evidence/postgres-enum-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).

## MongoDB browse metadata and cursor consistency — 2026-10-03

`fetch_rows` now builds collection-wide type metadata and retains requested
page rows from one cursor. A MongoDB 7 failpoint pauses `getMore` before an
off-page document is read, then a native update changes its field from String
to Decimal128. The returned page reports `mixed`, preserves its already-read
String rows as canonical Extended JSON, and the app refuses their edits. Native
reads verify the changed Decimal128 and unchanged sibling. A second failpoint
test skips the first `find` and blocks a second; the browse request completes
without that second command. The earlier inter-command regression failed with
stale `string` metadata and is retained as the before-fix result. The final
app-server layer passed all 12 registered tests.

The consistency contract is best-effort, not snapshot isolation. A deterministic
failpoint test updates `_id: 0` from String to Decimal128 after the cursor has
read it but before `getMore`; the returned row and census still say String while
a native read sees Decimal128. A concurrent change to a document the cursor
has already passed is therefore outside the metadata guarantee. Like other
editable database results, a later write can overwrite a concurrent change.

The shell `run_find` path still runs a full type census and then a filtered
query. It merges types from returned rows, so a selected row that changes kind
between those commands becomes `mixed`; off-page changes after census are not
visible to that merge. CSV and JSON export use the materialized query result and
preserve canonical Extended JSON markers for observed mixed values. Export does
not refresh data or establish a collection snapshot. A diagnostic Docker test
measures full-census time for 1,000 and 10,000 documents with a 50-row page;
results are machine-specific and have no pass/fail threshold. These boundaries
are covered by [the MongoDB census evidence manifest](evidence/mongodb-census-results-2026-10-03/manifest.json).
