# Platforms, toolchains and packaging

One page for what runs where. The [sprint](bookie-0.2-sprint.md) owns release
approval; [packaging](../packaging/README.md) owns package builds.

## Supported stacks

The build floor is the Ubuntu 24.04 stack: GTK 4.14, GLib 2.80, libadwaita 1.5
and GtkSourceView 5.12. Debian 13 (GTK 4.18, libadwaita 1.7) and newer are
above it. `scripts/test-distro-floor.sh` builds and runs the unit and widget
tiers on both in containers, and the Forgejo job `distro-floor` runs it on
every push. The installed AT-SPI pass on those distros is still open (PKG-2 in
the [ledger](known-issues.md)).

Neither distro packages Rust 1.98. Build with rustup.

## Rust toolchain

Rust 1.98 is the minimum supported version, declared in `rust-toolchain.toml`,
`Cargo.toml` and `clippy.toml`. CI compiles and lints with 1.98, and a weekly
job lints with current stable.

Arch's `rust` package installs `/usr/bin/cargo` directly and ignores
`rust-toolchain.toml`. Use Arch's `rustup` instead (the two conflict):

```bash
sudo pacman -S rustup
rustup toolchain install 1.98.0 --profile minimal --component rustfmt,clippy
rustup toolchain install stable --profile minimal --component clippy
rustup default stable
```

Inside `linux/` the pin selects 1.98. Use `cargo +stable clippy ...` for the
forward-compatibility check. Do not change the pin because Arch ships a newer
compiler. With the distro compiler, `scripts/preflight.sh` checks current stable,
not the minimum, so rely on CI for the 1.98 result.

## Arch and Omarchy package

The Arch package is an internal candidate, not an AUR or Flathub release. It
installs `bookie` and `bookie-agentd`, with `tablepro` aliases. The application
ID, D-Bus name, XDG paths and keyring schema stay `com.tablepro.linux` and
`tablepro`.

- Build from a clean tree at a recorded commit: `scripts/build-arch-rc.sh`
  refuses a dirty tree or a SHA that is not `HEAD`, then runs
  `makepkg --cleanbuild`, `namcap` and package-content checks.
- Saved connections, drafts, favorites and the audit journal live in
  `~/.config/tablepro` and `~/.local/share/tablepro`. Stop the app before an
  upgrade or rollback and never delete those directories or the keyring records.
- The package replaces and conflicts with `tablepro`. Install, upgrade and
  removal must keep user XDG data (PKG-6).
- Release evidence for 0.1.4: [archive/release-0.1.4.md](archive/release-0.1.4.md).

## Flathub

The Flatpak manifests (`../flatpak/com.tablepro.linux*`) build, but a manifest
build is not release qualification or publication. Submission checklist:

1. Capture screenshots under `flatpak/screenshots/` (1280x800 or larger):
   welcome, browse, editor, structure; reference them from the metainfo.
2. `flatpak-builder --user --install build-dir flatpak/com.tablepro.linux.json`.
3. `appstreamcli validate flatpak/com.tablepro.linux.metainfo.xml`.
4. Fork flathub/flathub, open the manifest PR, attach a release blurb.

Permissions stay minimal: network, home (saved connections, SSH keys) and
`org.freedesktop.secrets`. The manifests grant `--socket=ssh-auth` for the
built-in client's agent authentication. The system OpenSSH option needs a host
`ssh` and must refuse explicitly in the sandbox instead of falling back to the
built-in client.

## Accessibility

In tree: accessible names on primary chrome and the find fields, a shortcuts
window, Adwaita alert and preferences dialogs with default and close responses,
destructive styling only on the confirm response, status never by colour alone,
and multi-window through New Window.

Open before Flathub (DOC-3): an Orca pass over connect, browse, edit, run SQL and
disconnect; keyboard-only tab order through the connect dialog, sidebar, grid
and editor; high contrast and large text; accessible names on custom grid cells
and popovers.

Translations: `po/tablepro.pot` exists, new strings go through `tr!`, see
[../po/README.md](../po/README.md).
