# Archived sprint review: 2026-09-26 to 2026-09-28

Reviewed branch: `linux`. Frozen review tip: `85fecbe0b1d86d2deac3c040c63f24712333854a`.
Source version: 0.1.5; target sprint: 0.2.0. A version or changelog section does
not establish publication or release qualification.

Window: commits reachable from `refs/heads/linux` with committer timestamps from
2026-09-26 00:00 Europe/Vienna through the review tip on September 28. This covers
the two recent work days plus today's follow-ups. The inventory contains **117
commits: 115 non-merge commits and two merges**. Author dates can precede this
window. Merged side-branch commits are included once.

Review method: all commit subjects and changed-file inventories, current sprint,
B3 type/value evidence, B4 board and CI audit; selected source and diffs for current
transport, session, credential-cache, packaging and UI risks. This is a planning
review, not a line-by-line security audit of every diff. No application tests,
containers, hosted jobs or installed desktop checks were rerun during this review.
Existing results below belong to their recorded revisions and environments.

The [active continuation plan](bookie-0.2-sprint.md#current-continuation-plan-2026-10-03)
owns new work. This file archives delivered changes and their remaining limits;
it does not close B3, B4 or approve a release.

## What the work achieved

| Area | Delivered in this window | What remains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B2 / integration | Preserved local safeguards on the remote sprint foundation; preference migration marker, durable mirrors, history tests and owned MCP shutdown | Installed migration and rollback at the candidate SHA |
| B3 PostgreSQL | Wide NUMERIC and scale, arrays/dimensions/lower bounds, 24:00/timetz, eras/infinities, interval fields and vectors; independent server/wire oracles | Calendar extremes, remaining native families, exact editing and consumer parity |
| B3 other drivers | MySQL zero/extended temporals, BIT/spatial/decimal values and SQL-mode-safe literals; SQL Server wide decimals and stored offsets; ClickHouse precision/scale/named zones; DuckDB native decimal/temporal bindings; SQLite affinity imports; MongoDB canonical Extended JSON, nested and top-level edits, binary subtype preservation | Remaining targets in the [type matrix](type-contract-strategy.md), mixed-type editing and installed grid acceptance; refusal and text fallback must remain explicit |
| B3 consumers | Exact XLSX numeric/temporal/nested text; CSV empty/NULL distinction; XML/HTML character rules; binary SQL export, incomplete-row refusal, parser and mixed-binding regressions; MongoDB MCP/file round trips | Cross-format/consumer parity, generated boundaries and unresolved mutation findings |
| B4 SSH | Built-in auth/two-hop tests, keepalive and closed-state API; OpenSSH caller cancellation, parent-death cleanup, ProxyJump and real auth/key tests; unused auth mode removed | Built-in trust prompt, closed-tunnel monitor wiring and installed prompt/cleanup checks |
| B4 TLS | Service-name verification fixes for ClickHouse/MongoDB/Redis; SQL Server TLS fixture and no-plaintext-fallback regressions | MySQL and SQL Server TLS-through-SSH proof (C6); keep engine-specific claims |
| B4 sessions / daemon | Retired-session refusal, transaction terminal/audit corrections, real PostgreSQL D1/D2/D8 tests, fault-sink notification, post-connect cache digest, MCP shutdown deadline and unknown-key refusal | Shared-connection transaction rules, GUI lifecycle/identity, per-connection write recovery, unverifiable-cache refusal and daemon OpenSSH acceptance |
| UI | Full long-cell edit seeding, driver-specific form defaults, connection header and browse shortcut labels | Render the final layout and exercise defaults/shortcuts under Arch/Omarchy Wayland; an earlier centered-title commit was superseded by a left-aligned header with grouped actions |
| Build / evidence | Rust/toolchain/build reuse, layered runners, focused change-contract selection, immutable CI pins, strict result/artifact gates, SSH tier ownership and mutation shards | Evidence for the final tip, unresolved mutation survivors/timeouts, installed Arch package and candidate soak |
| Maintenance | ClickHouse helper split, MongoDB module split and function-size refactors | Requalify affected behavior; refactoring is not additional feature acceptance |

Detailed historical evidence remains in [value contracts](value-contracts.md),
[CI audit](ci-audit-2026-09-27.md), [B4 board](b4-task-board.md) and
[September 26 reconciliation](reconciliation-2026-09-26.md).

## Findings that affect the next plan

1. B3 and B4 remain open. The roadmap's previous statement that only qualification
   remained understated the open policy, GUI and transport implementation tasks.
2. B4 A5 delivered keepalive and `SshTunnel::is_closed()`, but `Tunnel` and the
   connection monitor do not consume that API. Retain the follow-up as F9.
3. Built-in GUI SSH still initializes `UnknownHostKey::Learn` in
   `app/src/services/database_service.rs`; F6 must implement user confirmation
   for initial connect and reconnect. Agentd's refusal is already separate.
4. Editor `SessionState(bool)` has no session identity; late completion can relabel
   a replacement session. F3 remains open. Close uses detached cleanup; F2 must
   settle rollback before window exit/disconnect.
5. `agentd/src/lib.rs` still reuses a healthy cache entry after material-digest
   failure, and can keep the pre-connect digest when post-connect verification
   fails. G3 must cover both failure points; G2 fixed the successful rotation case.
6. `scripts/build-deb.sh` builds/installs askpass, but
   `packaging/debian/rules` does not. I1 remains a Debian recipe/validator task,
   scheduled in the required GNOME/Debian phase after Arch acceptance. Do not redo the helper script.
7. The sprint's old Flatpak fallback text conflicts with recorded B4 decision 2.
   Implement and document explicit refusal (I2); do not infer it from missing tools.
8. CI audit records failed/incomplete broader mutation scopes. Focused successes
   do not close that triage. Old Xvfb/driver evidence cannot certify the review tip
   or native Wayland appearance.

## Complete commit inventory

Newest first, by Git traversal. Date is the committer date with its stored timezone offset. Area is a planning
classification, not a pass result. Each non-merge row records its delivered change
and the number of touched files; merge rows preserve their actual parents.
