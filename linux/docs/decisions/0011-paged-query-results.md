# 0011: Page large editor results through a cursor

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date**: 2026-10-07

## Context

A SQL editor result is materialized in one pass up to three caps: 1,000,000
rows, 10,000,000 cells and 64 MiB of estimated value bytes. The byte cap binds
first. GUI memory is about 2.5 times the driver result (PERF-2, PERF-8).
Full-table export already pages 5,000 rows through the guard, and the grid
reads shared rows lazily, so the remaining cost is the single large fetch of an
arbitrary query.

Re-running the user's statement with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` is not an option. It
rewrites SQL the user wrote, can repeat or miss rows when data changes, and
re-evaluates the whole statement per page. SEC-6 also requires that the cap
never appends a `LIMIT`.

## Decision

Add an optional driver capability that opens a forward-only cursor over a
single read statement and returns pages of at most 5,000 rows.

1. Only a statement that `PolicyGuard` classifies as a read, run in a
   `Session`, may open a cursor. Other statements keep the capped, materialized
   path.
2. PostgreSQL implements it with a server cursor inside the session's
   transaction. Other engines report the capability as unsupported and keep
   the capped path until each has a tested cursor.
3. The statement is classified, ruled and audited once. Each page fetch writes
   a page event under the same operation identifier. Masking applies to every
   page. A denied, failed, cancelled or timed-out fetch writes the terminal
   state and closes the cursor.
4. The grid keeps a fixed number of pages resident. A forward-only cursor
   cannot re-read an earlier page, so pages outside the retained budget are
   gone from the grid; the user exports the statement to get every row.
5. Cancel and timeout reach the server through the existing server-side
   cancellation. Closing the tab, switching connection or running a new
   statement closes the cursor.

## Consequences

- Memory is bounded by the page budget, not the result size, for PostgreSQL.
- Every page is a guarded, audited call. The audit journal grows with the
  number of pages, so the page size is fixed and a long scroll writes bounded
  events.
- A forward-only cursor cannot show earlier pages without keeping them. The
  retained-page budget decides what the user can scroll back to.
- Engines without a cursor keep the current caps and the truncated banner.

## Open questions

- Whether MySQL and SQL Server can use their native streaming without holding
  a transaction open.
- Whether the retained budget should be rows, bytes or both.
