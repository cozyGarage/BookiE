# Optional upstream reference review

The approved [BookiE convergence sprint](bookie-0.2-sprint.md) now includes shared
Rust/Linux foundations as well as behavior review. Apple source trees remain excluded.

## 2026-09-25: system OpenSSH transport

`crates/ssh/src/openssh/` ports upstream's system OpenSSH transport as a second
backend beside the russh `SshTunnel`, which is unchanged. Nothing outside the ssh
crate uses it yet; wiring it into `transport`, storage, the app and `agentd` is a
later slice.

Source: upstream `refs/remotes/upstream/linux` at `0e542e3c1`, files
`linux/crates/ssh/src/{argv,askpass_bridge,destination,prompt,runtime,session,forward,stderr_classify,supervisor,sweep}.rs`,
`src/bin/tablepro-askpass.rs`, `tests/{askpass_helper.rs,openssh_session.rs}` and
`tests/fixtures/stderr/*`. The feature landed in `d03430020 feat(ssh): add the system
OpenSSH transport with an askpass bridge`; `55528b854 fix(ssh): read the host key
fingerprint line from OpenSSH 9 as well` is carried in the prompt parser, which
closes the item the 2026-09-19 entry left open.

Taken largely as written: the ControlMaster argv and `-O` control commands, the
destination and jump-list parser, the askpass frame format and helper, the
handshake loop with its prompt-paused deadline, the supervisor's `-O exit`, grace
and kill sequence, the flock-guarded sweep, and the stderr classifier with its
fixture files copied verbatim.

Rewritten:

- Errors map to a new `OpenSshError` in the ssh crate. Upstream's
  `tablepro_core::SshFailure`, `TransportError`, `LivenessPolicy`,
  `NetworkEndpoint` and `Transport` trait do not exist here, so the crate keeps no
  dependency on `core`. Timeouts are an `OpenSshTimeouts` value, and a forward
  returns its local endpoint and the original target so a caller keeps the service
  host for TLS verification.
- No process-global state. Upstream's `TASKS` tracker and `SshServices`/
  `SshRuntimeCell` singletons became an explicit `OpenSshContext` holding the
  runtime, program paths and timeouts. The runtime base is
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tablepro`, falling back to a private `tablepro-<uid>` directory
  in the temp dir.
- Forced options add `StrictHostKeyChecking=ask`, so a user's `~/.ssh/config` cannot
  turn host-key checking off for the destination, plus `StreamLocalBindUnlink=no`,
  `SessionType=none` and `GatewayPorts=no`. Forwards can also use a loopback TCP
  port, not only a Unix socket.
- Credential answering is a security rewrite. Upstream answers the first
  `'s password:` prompt with the stored password whatever account it names, so a
  jump host could receive the destination's password. Here a stored password answers
  only a prompt naming exactly the configured `user@host`, and a stored passphrase
  only a prompt naming exactly the configured key path. Keyboard-interactive text is
  classified before the password suffix, so a server-supplied prompt cannot pose as
  a password prompt. Everything else, and every host-key confirmation, goes to a
  `Prompter` trait; `UnattendedPrompter` declines all of it. Confirmations need an
  explicit accept and secret prompts need a secret, so a mismatched answer cancels.
- The bridge rejects a peer with another uid as an error, bounds each frame to
  64 KiB, times out a peer that sends no prompt, and builds replies in `Zeroizing`
  buffers. The helper keeps the reply in a `Zeroizing` buffer too.
- Not ported: `known_hosts.rs` (`forget_host_key`) and upstream's
  `CredentialPrompt` mapping, which belong to the UI slice.

Tests: unit tests per module, a sandbox-tier `tests/openssh_fake_ssh.rs` that drives
a shell-script `ssh` through spawn, askpass, deadline, cancel, drop, kill-after-grace,
forwards and the sweep, and the Docker-gated `tests/openssh_session.rs`, which adds a
jump-host case proving the stored password never reaches the jump host's prompt.

Open: `-J` hops run a separate `ssh` that receives none of our `-o` options, so the
user's config still decides host-key checking for jump hosts.

## 2026-09-19: re-survey after upstream rewrote its Linux branch

`origin/linux` is 1,017 commits ahead of ours and 396 behind. The number is
misleading in three ways, and each one matters more than the total.

**The old pins are gone.** Upstream force-pushed `linux`, so
`5730238f5c72b4924669efbb7c0e79372de50a36`, the pin this document and the sprint
plan both cite, no longer resolves in the repository. `807d280944a9…` resolves
but is no longer an ancestor of `origin/linux`. Every "commits after X" count in
those documents is unverifiable against the current remote. Pin by subject as
well as SHA from now on; upstream `5730238f5` is the commit now called
`f3cbf7361 fix(linux): rebuild the GSettings schema when it changes and cover
SQLite in dev-env`.

**Only 200 of the 1,017 touch `linux/`.** The other 817 are Apple targets, the
plugin system, iOS sync and AI chat, all excluded by `CLAUDE.md`. Upstream now
ships database engines as versioned plugins (`plugin-teradata`, `plugin-trino`,
`plugin-typesense`, `plugin-weaviate` tags). That is the opposite of
[ADR 0001](decisions/0001-no-plugin-system.md) and of compile-time driver
registration. No action; recorded so the divergence is not rediscovered as a gap.

**Of those 200, 19 are new since our last review.** The rest are the rewritten
SHAs of commits the sprint plan already dispositioned. The 19 are:

| Kind | Commits |
| --- | --- |
| Features we do not have (13) | CSV import, Excel export, INSERT-statement export, Markdown/HTML/XML export, connection groups, connection import/export, connection colour tags, duplicate a connection, named saved queries, column comments, open a SQL file, JSON log format, recording the statements the app itself runs in history |
| Fixes in code we share (1) | `3bcd8df75` column rename |
| Fixes in code we do not have (1) | `55528b854` OpenSSH 9 askpass fingerprint parsing |
| Housekeeping (4) | roadmap, i18n extraction, two test-stability fixes |

### What the shared fixes cost us

`3bcd8df75` found a real defect in our tree. We already emit `RenameColumn`
ahead of the alter, but our alter guard still counted the name as a change, so a
column whose name alone changed raised an `AlterColumn` with nothing to do.
PostgreSQL and SQL Server swallowed it as `NoChange`. SQLite refused the entire
save, because it refuses every alter. MySQL emitted a redundant `MODIFY COLUMN`
that restates the definition from a model carrying no collation, character set
or comment. Fixed with a cross-dialect regression test.

`55528b854` does not apply: we have no askpass bridge. Carry it forward if the
system OpenSSH transport is ever adopted in B4.

One older commit deserves a separate check rather than a claim.
`92aea7112 fix(core): export values at the precision their column declares` sits
below the boundary, inside the 60 the sprint plan already dispositioned, under
"converge serializers". That row records an intention, not a verification, so
whether our exporter matches the declared precision is still unconfirmed.

### What we imported

`crates/core/src/import/csv_import.rs` is adapted from upstream `d91c70a92`
(`linux/crates/core/src/import/csv_import.rs`). Only the parser came across, and it was
rewritten against our `ColumnInfo` and `Value`: upstream's `CellInput`/`ColumnType` model
is part of their B3 contract and does not exist here. Nothing of their write path was
taken. Upstream's importer has no policy layer, so ours builds its statements with
`sql_dialect::build_insert_from_draft` and commits through a scoped approval on
`PolicyGuard` instead.

### What the excluded trees still taught us

`242b76e02 fix(plugin-postgresql): quote every catalog literal so a backslash
cannot escape it` is a whole bug class we are immune to: our PostgreSQL catalog
queries bind `$1`/`$2` rather than interpolating literals. The optional DuckDB
driver is the one place that still interpolates a schema and table name into a
quoted literal, through an `escape_literal` that doubles quotes and ignores
backslashes. DuckDB does not treat a backslash as an escape in an ordinary
string, so this is not the same defect, but binding the parameters would remove
the question.

`fix(plugin-postgresql): report each column's declared type, and compare it`
(#2959) is the most useful thing in the whole survey for B3. Upstream concluded
that a column needs both the name it is classified by and the spelling its own
schema declares, because collapsing them loses collation, MySQL display width,
enum label case and schema-qualified spellings. Our `ColumnInfo.data_type` is a
single string. Design B3 for two fields, not one.

## 2026-09-16: script planner and safe formatting

- Reference: `TableProApp/TablePro` Linux `5730238f5c72b4924669efbb7c0e79372de50a36`,
  changes `f483e4169` and `50a515a36`.
- Imported the standalone `sql_syntax/script` modules and grammar enumeration,
  and the editor `format_plan`/`significant_tokens` modules with their tests.
- Connected formatting to the owning connection's dialect. Unsupported/non-SQL
  connections do not silently format as PostgreSQL. Existing execution/policy
  splitting remains unchanged until its contract migration is verified.
- Storage changes follow the upstream complete-draft and ordered-writer behavior,
  integrated with this fork's existing workspace queue and close-time failure UI.
- Verification is recorded in the sprint implementation ledger; imports alone
  do not complete the planned session or driver contract switch.

TablePro Linux is an independent Rust and GTK codebase. Other TablePro implementations may be reviewed as references for security fixes, product behavior, SQL semantics, and user expectations. This review is optional and is not a source synchronization process.

## Rules

- Never merge, rebase, or cherry-pick Apple source trees into this repository.
- Do not copy platform framework code or assume another implementation's architecture applies to Linux.
- Inspect the behavior and the reason for the change.
- Check whether the same risk or product need exists in the Rust and GTK application.
- Manually implement only the behavior that applies to Linux.
- Keep existing Linux policy, audit, storage, GTK ownership, and driver boundaries intact.
- Add Rust tests that prove the ported behavior here.
- Omit changes that depend on platform services with no Linux equivalent unless there is a clear Linux product requirement.

## Good review targets

Reference review is most useful for:

- SQL safety classification and approval rules
- Credential handling and redaction
- Connection cancellation and reconnect behavior
- TLS and SSH identity checks
- Data-grid correctness and destructive-action guards
- User-facing behavior that should be consistent across TablePro products

Packaging, desktop integration, process management, keyrings, and UI framework details should follow native Linux behavior instead.

## Recording a manual port

Add an entry only when a reference review causes a Linux code or product change. Routine Linux development does not need an entry.

```text
## YYYY-MM-DD: short behavior name

- Reference reviewed: repository, ref, and commit or release.
- Linux relevance: risk or product behavior that also applies here.
- Manual port: Rust or GTK behavior implemented in this repository.
- Not ported: platform-specific parts that do not apply.
- Verification: focused tests, real-driver fixture, or GTK flow run.
```

The entry should describe behavior, not file-by-file source movement. There should be no source-tree merge to record.

## 2026-09-14: Linux safety and SQL character warnings

- Reference reviewed: `TableProApp/TablePro` main through `035ffe8f771797345ad86032e3aead16f18181fe`, verified remotely on September 14; local Linux baseline `5dbf87a44`.
- Manual behavior adoption: `a45fb4672` character warnings, `c180dbcac` cancellable/atomic export, and `558502f87` catalog refresh. Linux uses native Rust/GTK implementations, owning-connection identity, shared serializers and off-thread loaded-row export.
- Additional Linux fixes: dialect-aware IN literals and lexical spans, Redis browse isolation, MongoDB JSON/BSON numbers, and structure-save notification without rename. Updated a yanked transitive dependency.
- Not ported: Apple source/UI/services, plugin ABI, new engines or full database dump/restore. Existing Linux filters and reopen stack remain; further parity work is deferred.
- Verification and remaining gates: [September 14 sprint ledger](sprint-2026-09-14.md). This is a source/behavior review, not a macOS runtime test or release approval.

## 2026-08-18: exact wide integers, export target, and unterminated SQL literals

- Reference reviewed: `TableProApp/TablePro` `origin/main` at `f696b5f3`, commits `060e5ea4` (preserve wide integer values), `e055dcd0` (export from the database you picked), and `00885a7e` (Format Query on an unterminated SQL literal).
- Linux relevance: the GTK grid edited integer cells through a spin button backed by `f64`, so opening the editor on an integer wider than 2^53 rewrote the value; streaming CSV export read from the active connection instead of the browse tab that owns the selection; unterminated literals are a known parser hazard.
- Manual port: integer cells wider than the exact `f64` range, and values that do not parse, now open an exact text editor instead of a spin button. CSV export resolves the browse tab's own connection and reports a closed connection instead of exporting from another one.
- Not ported: macOS view models, the Liquid Glass and Open Quickly work, license gating, and the display-format state machine. Linux has no SQL formatter, so the Format Query crash has no equivalent; the statement splitter was reviewed and covered with unterminated-literal tests instead.
- Verification: `cargo test -p tablepro-app --bins` covers the numeric editor choice, export connection resolution, and unterminated literals in both splitter paths.

## 2026-08-22: data-grid and result-correctness review, v0.62.0 through v0.67.1

- Reference reviewed: `TableProApp/TablePro` `origin/main` at `159be66f5` (v0.67.1), covering the `Fixed` and `Security` entries of v0.62.0 through v0.67.1. The heaviest churn was the data grid and the SQL editor.
- Linux relevance: eleven upstream fix clusters were checked against Rust code paths. Five described a defect that also existed here; six do not apply, because the Linux architecture differs in a way that rules the defect out. Two defects found while checking were not on the upstream list at all.
- Manual port:
  - A statement boundary now follows the connected engine's quoting, so a PostgreSQL dollar-quoted body runs whole and a semicolon inside a MySQL `#` comment is not a boundary. One dialect-aware lexer in `tablepro_core::sql_lex` replaced the editor's own splitter.
  - Statements that read a host file, run a program, or send SQL to another server classify as administrative, so a read-only agent token is refused.
  - Stop and the query timeout abort the running statement on the server for MySQL, ClickHouse and SQLite, matching the PostgreSQL behaviour that was already verified. SQL Server retires the connection instead, because tiberius cannot send the TDS attention packet.
  - Copy row as INSERT omits generated columns, which every engine rejects, and escapes each value the way the connected engine reads it.
  - A cell edit is discarded if the row it opened on is no longer at that position, instead of being written to whichever row took its place.
- Not applicable, with the reason:
  - Results wrongly editable for `UNION`, joins, subqueries and CTEs: the Linux editor renders results read-only, so no table identity is ever inferred from a result set.
  - Rows-per-page overflow crashing, a page number typed for one tab applying to another, and rows past a row-count estimate being unreachable: page size comes from a fixed dropdown, pagination state is per browse tab, row counts are exact rather than estimated, and Next is enabled from the page being full rather than from a total.
  - A failing query showing a blank result area: the failing statement's own message is already rendered in its result tab.
  - ClickHouse Verify Ca falling back to public roots: a named certificate authority replaces the public roots outright, and an unreadable or empty authority file is an error.
- Found while reviewing, not on the upstream list:
  - The rendered INSERT escaped only quotes. MySQL and ClickHouse read a backslash as an escape, so a stored value ending in one closed the literal early and the rest parsed as SQL. Confirmed against MySQL 8.1, which evaluated the payload as an expression and returned 1.
  - Every SQLite column with no declared type decoded as NULL, so `count(*)` and any expression showed an empty cell.
- Verification: `tablepro_core::sql_lex` and `sql_literal` unit tests, `crates/core/tests/query_pipeline.rs`, the MySQL, ClickHouse, SQLite and SQL Server container suites, the PostgreSQL release fixture, and the installed GTK suite.

## 2026-09-07: PostgreSQL filters, metadata ownership and offline DuckDB

- Reference reviewed: TableProApp/TablePro v0.72.0 at `6e6396c590bc1cc37f5e71e6d98d563dfcf8a2d6`, including `TableProTests/Core/Database/FilterSQLGeneratorColumnTypeTests.swift`, `Plugins/TableProPluginKit/PluginQueryTiming.swift`, and release fixes for filters, stale sidebar state, transaction ownership and offline extensions.
- Linux relevance: non-text pattern filters emitted invalid PostgreSQL operators, the daemon view wrapper inherited an empty default, sidebar refresh lacked connection identity, and DuckDB JSON functions required a downloaded extension.
- Manual port: PostgreSQL text-pattern conversion; ordinary/controlled view forwarding; stale-sidebar rejection; bundled JSON/Parquet. Invalid count fallback and redundant post-DDL browse reads were additional Linux findings. Structure/editor transactions use separate pooled handles; a real-engine regression confirms isolation.
- Not ported: Apple UI, plugins, licensing, bulk dump/restore behavior without a Linux counterpart. Timing remains a specified follow-up, not fabricated engine time.
- Historical verification: [stabilization ledger](stabilization-2026-09.md); [performance evidence](performance-2026-09.md). No Apple source tree was merged.

The editor now uses the imported planner for execution and run-at-cursor as well
as formatting, following upstream `statement_cursor.rs`. Fork differences: retain
policy/audit dispatch, parameter prompts and run-generation ownership; stop the
whole script on errors; reject `GO n` rather than silently ignoring repetition;
keep the existing scanner for the additional non-upstream drivers. Run-at-cursor
passes the already planned statement directly, so MySQL custom delimiters are
not lost by planning the isolated procedure again.
