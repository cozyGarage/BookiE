# Architecture

**BookiE** is a Linux-only native database client. Two composition roots (the GTK app and the headless MCP daemon) share one governed path: resolve credentials → open a tunnel if needed → wrap the driver in `PolicyGuard` → classify / approve / mask / execute / audit → return bounded results. There is no browser UI, no runtime driver plugin ABI, and no remote entitlement gate.

The Cargo workspace lives under `linux/` (Rust 1.98). Crate and Cargo binary names stay `tablepro-*`. Packaging and Meson install `bookie` / `bookie-agentd` and add `tablepro` / `tablepro-agentd` aliases. App ID, XDG paths, keyring schema, UUIDs, audit format and protocol contracts stay `tablepro` / `com.tablepro.linux`. Check the [active sprint](docs/bookie-0.2-sprint.md) before renaming any of them.

This page is the one-page map. Accepted [ADRs](docs/decisions/README.md) constrain behaviour; [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) owns contributor rules; the sprint owns sequencing. Capability behaviour extracted from code lives under [`specs/`](../specs/README.md).

## How it runs

| Mode | Process | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop | `bookie` (`tablepro-app`) | GTK on the GLib main context; DB work on Tokio via Relm4 commands |
| Headless MCP | `bookie-agentd` (`tablepro-agentd`) | Same static drivers and `PolicyGuard` path; no GTK |
| Development profile | Either binary with `TABLEPRO_PROFILE=development` | Uses `tablepro-devel` XDG paths and a separate keyring schema |
| Validation | Scripts under `linux/scripts/` | Cheap tier locally / on GitHub; merge tier on Forgejo ([playbook](docs/validation-playbook.md#ci-tiers)) |

Native library floors (build/CI vs GNOME 50 package line) are in [ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-rust-gtk4-libadwaita.md) and [platforms](docs/platforms.md).

## System context

One actor: the person at a Linux desktop (or an MCP client they run). BookiE stays on their machine. Outbound traffic is only to databases and SSH bastions they configure. There is no BookiE cloud account.

```mermaid

    mcpClient["MCP client<br/>agent / IDE"]
    bookie["bookie<br/>GTK4 / Relm4"]
    agentd["bookie-agentd<br/>MCP host"]
    keyring["Secret Service"]

    bookie --> keyring
    agentd --> keyring
    bookie --> bastion
    agentd --> bastion
    bookie --> db
    agentd --> db
    bastion --> db
```

Both processes register the same static drivers and must obtain a `PolicyGuard` before any consumer sees a live database handle.

## Containers (crates)

Dependencies point downward. `tablepro-core` is the dependency-free contract layer. The UI never depends on a concrete driver crate.

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `tablepro-app` | GTK composition root. Cargo binary `tablepro-app`; installed as `bookie`. |
| `tablepro-agentd` | Headless MCP composition root. Cargo binary `tablepro-agentd`; installed as `bookie-agentd`. |
| `tablepro-core` | Domain types, driver traits, values, filters, transactions, registry. No workspace dependency. |
| `tablepro-policy` | Classify, rules, approval, masking, blast radius, audit types, `PolicyGuard`. Depends on `core` only. |
| `tablepro-storage` | Saved connections, Secret Service, query history, audit journal. |
| `tablepro-ssh` | Built-in `russh` tunnels and optional system OpenSSH backend. |
| `tablepro-transport` | Saved-connection → dial options, SSH chain, tunnel, TLS service identity. |
| `tablepro-mcp` | MCP auth, scopes, connection allowlists, rate limits, tools. Never exposes a raw driver connection. |
| `tablepro-driver-*` | One static crate per engine. |
| `tablepro-driver-tls-tests` / `tablepro-release-tests` | Test-only fixtures. |

`crates/drivers/shared/` holds shared test helpers and is not a workspace member. Domain and driver crates never import GTK or Relm4.

## Trait boundaries

These traits are the seams that keep engines and UI replaceable. Behaviour details live in the specs and ADRs; this page only names the contracts.

| Trait / type | Crate | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `DatabaseDriver` | `core` | Connect and advertise engine capabilities. |
| `Connection` | `core` | Query, execute, schema, transactions, controlled cancel. |
| `OperationControl` | `core` | Cancellation token + optional deadline that reach the driver. |
| `PolicyGuard` | `policy` | Only consumer-facing `Connection`. Classify → decide → approve → mask → execute → audit. |
| `ApprovalSink` / `AuditSink` | `policy` | Pluggable approval UI and durable journal writes. |
| `ConnectionProvider` | `mcp` | Must return a policy-gated handle; no raw driver escape hatch. |
| `ConnectionFaultSink` | `policy` | Optional: app/agentd learn the connection is unusable after panic/desync. |

Adding an engine means implementing `DatabaseDriver` + `Connection` behind those traits, not teaching the UI a new driver id ([ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-no-plugin-system.md)).

## Governed request pipeline

One path for the GTK app, MCP tools and `bookie-agentd`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Consumer<br/>UI / MCP / agentd
    participant S as storage
    participant T as transport
    participant D as driver Connection
    participant G as PolicyGuard
    participant A as audit journal

    U->>S: Resolve saved connection + secrets
    S-->>U: Dial inputs (secrecy-wrapped)
    U->>T: Assemble route (SSH?, TLS identity)
    T->>D: Connect (static crate)
    D-->>U: Boxed Connection
    U->>G: Wrap as PolicyGuard
    U->>G: Statement / tool call
    G->>G: classify → rules → approval?
    alt Denied or audit-intent fail
        G->>A: terminal denied / fail-closed
        G-->>U: PolicyDenied
    else Allowed
        G->>A: audit intent
        G->>D: execute (OperationControl)
        D-->>G: result / error
        G->>G: mask
        G->>A: terminal succeeded / failed / cancelled / timed_out
        G-->>U: bounded result
    end
    Note over U: Apply only if generation / request id still matches
```

| Stage | Owner | Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| Resolve | `storage` | Secrets stay in Secret Service / `secrecy` until the driver boundary. |
| Assemble route | `transport` | Dial endpoint and TLS service identity are separate fields. |
| Guard | `policy` | No raw driver handle leaves MCP or agentd. |
| Statement | `policy` | Preview, transaction, retry and batch use the same checks as direct execution. |
| Audit | `storage` journal | Denied, failed, cancelled and timed-out work still get a terminal outcome. Audit failure never opens a path around policy. |
| Apply result | consumer | Late async outcomes must not replace a newer generation. |

## Import DAG

Nothing points back up. Cycles are forbidden. Composition roots sit at the top; `core` is the leaf.

```text
tablepro-app ────────┐
tablepro-agentd ─────┼──► mcp, policy, storage, transport, ssh, drivers, core
tablepro-release-tests┘

tablepro-mcp        ──► policy, storage, core
tablepro-transport  ──► storage, ssh, core
tablepro-storage    ──► policy (audit types), ssh (config types), core
tablepro-policy     ──► core
tablepro-ssh        ──► (leaf for tunnels; config types consumed by storage/transport)
tablepro-driver-*   ──► core
tablepro-core       ──► (no workspace crate)
```

Rules that keep this sound:

1. **Two composition roots only.** `app` and `agentd` register drivers and assemble services. Domain crates do not construct GTK widgets or start Relm4.
2. **One governance seam.** Every live database handle a consumer sees is a `PolicyGuard`. Token scopes and connection allowlists never replace it.
3. **Static drivers.** Engines are linked at build time and registered in code. There is no plugin discovery ABI ([ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-no-plugin-system.md)).
4. **Trust at the edges.** MCP input, saved connection files, imported files, environment variables and database metadata are untrusted input.

## Where new code goes

| You are changing | Put it here |
|---|---|
| GTK widget, Relm4 component, tab or browse UX | `crates/app` (main context only for widgets) |
| Headless MCP process wiring | `crates/agentd` |
| MCP tool, token scope, allowlist or rate limit | `crates/mcp` (must still return a `PolicyGuard`) |
| Classify, approve, mask, blast radius, audit types | `crates/policy` |
| Saved connections, keyring, history, audit journal | `crates/storage` |
| Dial options, SSH chain, TLS service identity | `crates/transport` / `crates/ssh` |
| Shared value, result, driver or cancel contracts | `crates/core` |
| A database engine | New `crates/drivers/<engine>` + both composition roots ([adding drivers](docs/adding-drivers.md)) |
| Architecture or behaviour rule | An [ADR](docs/decisions/README.md); do not invent a parallel rule in a board |
| Current capability description extracted from code | [`specs/`](../specs/README.md) (draft until reviewed; ADRs and AGENTS rank above it) |
| Open work, evidence, owner | The [ledger](docs/known-issues.md) or the owning B3/B4 board |

Helpers stay in the crate that owns the behaviour. Do not grow a cross-crate “utils” layer to avoid a decision about ownership.

## Boundary checklist

- Dependencies point toward `core`. No cycles. Drivers and domain crates never import GTK or Relm4.
- Consumers never hold a raw driver `Connection`; only a `PolicyGuard`.
- Secrets stay in Secret Service / `secrecy` until the driver boundary; never in JSON, argv, traces or audit fields.
- Dial target and TLS verify hostname are separate fields under SSH ([transport](#transport-and-service-identity)).
- Late async results apply only when the generation or request id still matches.
- Preview, transaction, retry and batch paths use the same policy checks as direct execution.

## Authority boundaries

Three MCP checks answer different questions. None replaces another:

| Boundary | Answers | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| MCP token scopes | Who may call which tools? | `tablepro-mcp` |
| Connection allowlists | Which saved connections may that token use? | `tablepro-mcp` |
| `PolicyGuard` | What SQL may run, how is it masked, and what is audited? | `tablepro-policy` |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    token[MCP token] --> scopes{scopes?}
    scopes -->|no| deny1[deny]
    scopes -->|yes| allowlist{connection<br/>allowlisted?}
    allowlist -->|no| deny2[deny]
    allowlist -->|yes| guard[PolicyGuard]
    guard --> sql{SQL decision}
    sql -->|deny| auditD[audit denied]
    sql -->|allow| exec[execute + mask + audit]
```

MCP may ask policy whether a statement needs write capability for a scope check; it does not evaluate rules or write audit records itself. A missing token, scope, allowlist entry or policy decision denies access.

| Concern | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Audit durability | Intent before driver execution; terminal outcome after. Fail-closed on required audit write failures. |
| Driver panic | Guard catches unwind: reads → `Internal`, writes → `OperationOutcomeUnknown`. Payload withheld from errors, audit fields and the guard's `tracing` event (operation + message length only). Unwinding strategy: [ADR 0006](docs/decisions/0006-driver-panic-containment.md). |
| Fault sink | Optional `ConnectionFaultSink`. `app` wakes the connection monitor; `agentd` marks the session unusable for replacement; `mcp` installs no sink. Fault path skips ping. |

## State ownership

| State | Owner |
|---|---|
| Saved connections + Secret Service refs | `tablepro-storage` |
| Live tunnel / dial target + TLS identity | `tablepro-transport` / `tablepro-ssh` |
| Policy decision + audit terminal outcome | `tablepro-policy` + audit journal |
| MCP token hash, scopes, allowlist | `tablepro-mcp` |
| GTK widgets / Relm4 component state | `tablepro-app` (main context only) |
| Tab UUID, dirty rows, result generation | `tablepro-app` tab controllers |
| Browse pages (`RowStore`) | `tablepro-app` UI + bounded fetch plans |
| Driver protocol connection | Inner `Connection` behind `PolicyGuard` |

## Transport and service identity

`ConnectOptions` separates **where bytes are dialed** from **which hostname TLS must verify**.

| Mode | Dial target | TLS service identity |
|---|---|---|
| Direct | Saved host:port | Saved host |
| SSH + non-verifying | Local loopback TCP forward | Usually unused for cert checks |
| SSH + Verify CA/Full | Unix socket in a private directory when the driver reports a forwarded socket name; otherwise TCP | Saved database hostname (not `127.0.0.1`) |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    saved["saved host:port"] -->|identity| tls["TLS verify<br/>hostname / CA"]
    saved -->|SSH forward| local["local socket or<br/>127.0.0.1:ephemeral"]
    local -->|dial| driver["driver"]
```

PostgreSQL uses the socket form so the certificate is checked against the real database hostname while traffic crosses the bastion. Unsupported combinations fail closed. See [connections.md](docs/connections.md) and B4 C6.

## Driver contract

Each engine exports a type implementing `tablepro_core::DatabaseDriver`. Connect returns a boxed `Connection` covering query execution, parameters, schema inspection, transactions, server activity and controlled cancellation where supported.

| Engine | Library | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | SQLx | Separate control pool for server-confirmed cancel; release fixture |
| MySQL / MariaDB | SQLx | Driver + TLS fixtures |
| SQLite | SQLx | Local and GTK tests |
| SQL Server | Tiberius | Cancellation and auth limits; Kerberos optional |
| ClickHouse | `clickhouse` | Driver + TLS fixtures |
| Redis | `redis` | Experimental; single host/port in 0.2.0 |
| MongoDB | `mongodb` | Experimental |
| DuckDB | DuckDB | Optional workspace feature |

`rust_decimal` is the shared decimal carrier; exact support is recorded per type/consumer under [ADR 0007](docs/decisions/0007-type-and-value-preservation.md). Session trust: [ADR 0008](docs/decisions/0008-connection-and-session-ownership.md). Durable identity: [ADR 0009](docs/decisions/0009-persistence-and-identity-compatibility.md). Registration: [adding drivers](docs/adding-drivers.md).

## UI and async ownership

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Threading | GTK objects stay on the GLib main context. DB and blocking work run on Tokio via Relm4 commands; results return as component messages. |
| Command scope | Component-scoped commands for tab/component lifetime. Detached Relm4 tasks only for independent persistence/cleanup. |
| Tabs | `AdwTabView` workspaces; Relm4 controllers keyed by tab UUID. |
| Browse grid | Bounded pages in `RowStore` (`gio::ListModel`); weakly cached `RowObject`s. |
| SQL editor results | Materialized up to caps. Progressive server-cursor paging accepted in [ADR 0011](docs/decisions/0011-paged-query-results.md), not implemented (PERF-2/PERF-8). |
| Identity | Sidebar refresh tokens hold a weak session reference. Tab results keep their tab UUID across connection switches. |

## Persistence

Config and history live under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tablepro/` (or `tablepro-devel` in development builds). The audit journal is under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tablepro/`. Passwords and SSH secrets stay in Secret Service through `oo7`. Schema id: `com.tablepro.linux`. Details: [storage.md](docs/storage.md), [ADR 0009](docs/decisions/0009-persistence-and-identity-compatibility.md).

## Build and validation

Default workspace Clippy/unit checks exclude optional DuckDB. GitHub runs the cheap tier; merge acceptance is the Forgejo gate. Commands and CI split: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the [validation playbook](docs/validation-playbook.md#ci-tiers).

## Deliberate limits

| Limit | Why |
|---|---|
| Linux only (today) | One developer; GTK/libadwaita stack. Shared crates stay UI-free so a later platform can reuse them. |
| Static drivers | Compile-time registration; no plugin ABI. |
| No embedded browser | Native GTK widgets only. |
| No in-process user scripting | Reduces attack surface beside SQL policy. |
| Redis single endpoint | Sentinel/Cluster deferred past 0.2.0. |
| Packaging | Arch x86_64 first, Debian/GNOME amd64 next. Flatpak / Flathub are left out of 0.2.0 ([PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md)). A recipe is not publication. |

## Studied from for document structure

Peers whose architecture pages shaped how this map is written (diagrams, seam tables, deliberate limits). Not a product roadmap to copy. BookiE stays Linux-native, multi-engine, and PolicyGuard-first; [PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md) and [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) own scope.
